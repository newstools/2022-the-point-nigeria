 The Academic Staff Union of Universities is still holding its National Executive Council meeting at the University of Lagos, Akoka. The meeting by the union commenced on Saturday. As of the time of filing this report, ASUU had yet to decide on whether it would embark on the proposed strike action or not. It was gathered that principal officers of ASUU, as well as branch chairmen and delegates from various institutions, including OOU, UNAAB, TASUED, UNN, AAU Ekpoma, AAUA, UNIABUJA, EBSU, UI and UNILORIN, among others were at the meeting. An ASUU NEC member at the ongoing meeting (craved anonymity), was quoted as saying that “There will be a press conference tomorrow (Monday), and our position will be announced. “But for now, the meeting is still ongoing and may span till night, and no one can say where the direction of the meeting is heading to yet. “The final decision on strike will be decided through voting, and all the members present would vote either for or against it.” He listed the union’s demands to include, “The issue of irregular/non-payment of salaries and subventions in state universities, refusal of Visitors to state universities to fund existing universities, rather they keep on establishing new ones, the issue of IPPIS which the union is clamoring for to be replaced with the University Transparency and Accountability System.” According to him, members of the union are not happy with the state of things but will go with the final decision of NEC.
