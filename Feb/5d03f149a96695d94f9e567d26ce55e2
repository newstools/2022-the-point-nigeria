 A magistrates’ court sitting in Abeokuta, Ogun State, on Thursday, ordered the remand of four teenagers over the murder of one Sofiat Okeowo. The suspects, Balogun Mustakeem (20), Majekodunmi Soliudeen (18), Abdulgafa Lukman (19) and Waris Oladeinde (18), were arrested on Saturday for allegedly slaughtering and burning the head of the victim, identified as a girlfriend to one of them, for money rituals. The police arraigned them on Thursday on a two-count charge of conspiracy and murder. The prosecutor, Lawrence Balogun, told the court that the defendants committed the offence on January 28, at Kugba area of Abeokuta. Balogun said the defendants conspired among themselves and murdered Sofiat Okeowo who was a girlfriend to Soliudeen. He said the defendants killed her by cutting off her head with a cutlass with the plan to use the head for money ritual. The Magistrate, I. O Abudu, did not take the plea of the defendants and ordered that they should be remanded in prison pending legal advice from the Ogun State Director of Public Prosecution and adjourned the case to March 14.
