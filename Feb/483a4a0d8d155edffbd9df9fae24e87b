 BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO The Osun State Police Command has arraigned a 29-year-old-man, Oyewale Oyabiyi, at a Magistrate’s Court sitting in Osogbo for allegedly defiling a five-year-old-girl (name withheld). Oyabiyi, who is facing one-count-charge of sexual assault, was said to have unlawfully had sexual intercourse with the minor without having her consent. The defendant is said to be living in the same residence with the victim’s mother at Kolawole area of Osogbo. The police prosecutor, Elisha Olusegun, informed the court that Oyabiyi committed the act on May 3, 2021 around 12am, at Kolawole area of Osogbo. The defendant allegedly parked out of the building after being granted administrative bail by the police last year. Olusegun told the court that the accused person committed the offence contrary to and punishable under Section 31(1)(2) of the Child’s Right Law of Osun State, 2007 and Section 360 of the Criminal Code, Cap 34, Volume II Laws of the state, 2002. However, the defendant pleaded not guilty to the allegation. The defence counsel, Kasia Mobi Ngwoke, prayed the court to admit the accused person to bail in liberal terms, assuring the court that Oyabiyi would provide reliable surety and would not abuse the bail privilege. However, the police prosecutor objected to the bail application on the ground that the defendant failed to show up at the police station after being admitted to administrative bail. In view of this, Olusegun said that the defendant would jump bail if granted. Magistrate A. A. Adebayo admitted the accused person to bail in the sum of N1, 000,000 with two sureties in like amount. He said that the sureties must be residents of Osun State and they must furnish the court with evidence of tax clearance. The case was adjourned till March 21 for hearing.
