 A Chief Magistrate’s Court, on Tuesday, ordered the remand of five persons at the correctional centre in Ado-Ekiti over allegations of conspiracy and attempted murder. The accused persons are Damisa Ibrahim, 32; Abdulsalam Nurudeen, 28; Lucky Bayo, 22; Adebayo Godwin, 26 and Ojo Musa, 45. The Prosecutor, Insp. Bankole Olasunkanmi, told the court that the accused person committed the offences on February 4, at Ago Aduloju Village in Ado-Ekiti. He alleged that the suspects conspired to rob and murder Abdulhameed Musa and Femi Raheem. Olasunkanmi also alleged that the defendants were found to be members of a cult group named Eiye Confraternity, adding that one of the victims claimed in his statement that they were attacked on their way to a restaurant. “One of the defendants stopped and attacked one of the victims, and when his friend intervened, the other defendants descended on both of them, injuring them with deep cutlass and axe cuts,’’ he said. The prosecutor added that the victims were rescued and taken to a nearby clinic from where they were referred to the Afe Babalola Multi-system Hospital, Ado Ekiti. According to him, the offences contravened the Robbery and Firearms Laws of the Federation and the Criminal Code Laws of Ekiti State, 2012. He urged the court to remand the defendants at the correctional centre pending the release of legal advice from the office of the Director of Public Prosecution. The court did not take the pleas of the defendants. Chief Magistrate Michael Faola ordered the remand of the defendants at the correctional centre in Ado-Ekiti pending issuance of legal advice and adjourned the case to March 4 for mention. (NAN).
