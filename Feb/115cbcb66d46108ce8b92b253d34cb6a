 Afiz Agate, a prominent member of the Oyo State Park Management System, has reportedly been shot dead in Ibadan, the state capital. Agate was said to have been killed in a clash between the PMS and another group known as Federal Boys. Several other persons were reportedly injured during the prolonged clash. However, details of what led to the clash were yet to be known as of the time of filing this report, but our correspondent learnt that security personnel alongside the personnel of the South-West Security Network, codenamed Amotekun, were on hand in the area to restore peace. It was gathered that the crisis started on Thursday evening at Oremeji Agugu area of Ibadan. The Public Relations Officer of PMS in the state, Alhaji Emiola Jelili, said that the Federal Boys were not drivers but area boys who extorted motorists at Oremeji area. “There was no fight among us. What happened was that there are area boys called Federal Boys. They are not drivers but they extort drivers. We have reported them to the Police at Agugu station but nothing was done. “Someone told us that the police could not do anything to them because some of the policemen connived with them. “But yesterday, while the robbery at Iwo Road was going on, there was gridlock on the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway and the Federal Boy’s used that also to be robbing people in the traffic. “Some of those who escaped ran to our park in the area but the boys still pursued them. We had to drive them back. They came back and attacked our offices after we closed. Security agents have taken over the place now.” He said. Also, confirming the incident, the state Commandant of Amotekun, Col. Olayinka Olayanju, said that one person was killed among the Federal Boys. “Yes, we have been on it since yesterday. We restored normalcy this morning but they have started the fracas again. “One person was killed among the Federal Boys and the corpse is still on the floor at Oremeji, but everything is under control,” he added.
