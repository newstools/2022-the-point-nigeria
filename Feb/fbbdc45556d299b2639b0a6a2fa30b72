 A logistics company says it has started the construction of a distribution hub in Ogoja Local Government Area of Cross River State to facilitate medical drone deliveries in the state. Its Country Manager, Catherine Odiase, made the declaration in a statement issued in Lagos on Sunday after the flag-off of the construction at the site. “Our partnership with Cross River transcends delivery of medical supplies. We are on a mission to reinvent healthcare delivery systems through cutting edge solutions. “This is with a view to ensuring healthy lives and promoting the well-being for all. “Upon completion, due in about four months, the hub will facilitate deliveries of vital medical supplies to health facilities that serve millions of people across the state,’’ the statement read. It added that the hub would support all health facilities with emergency responses, as well as routine and stock-out deliveries of medicines, vaccines, and blood all-week long. The Cross River State Commissioner for Health, Dr Betta Edu, said the hub marked a milestone in improving healthcare delivery in the state. Edu lauded the partnership between the state government and the logistics company saying it would further ensure even distribution of medical supplies in the state. The Special Adviser to the Governor on Health, Dr David Ushie, noted that the initiative would remove barriers being encountered in getting supplies to hard-to-reach areas of the state. He, therefore, enjoined the Ogoja community to give their support so as to ensure timely delivery of the project. (NAN).
