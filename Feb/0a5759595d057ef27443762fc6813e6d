 Aggrieved pensioners in Ekiti State are currently seeking the face of God in prayers over their unpaid N2 billion gratuities by the state government. The elderly citizens took their petitions to God during an interdenominational prayer session held at the Nigeria Union of Pensioners, Oke-Bareke in Ado-Ekiti, on Tuesday. The pensioners prayed to God to touch the heart of the state governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, to pay the arrears of their outstanding gratuities and pensions. They also prayed for the growth of the nation’s economy and the return of peace into the country, particularly in view of the coming governorship elections in the state. The NUP Chairman in Ekiti State, Joel Akinola, lamented that many pensioners in the state had died without getting their benefits as many battled various illnesses due to lack of funds. Akinola said, “Ekiti government owes gratuities to the tune of N2 billion and outstanding pensions accumulating to millions of naira. We hope that the governor would pay a substantial amount of the debt before leaving office. Each time there is transition of power; it is often difficult to agitate or confront the new governor because they will be quick to tell you that they are not the ones owing us. “We have laboured and served our nation and state meritoriously for 35 years; we deserve better than what we have been getting.” He urged the state government to endeavour to pay for the survival of those of them who are alive. In his sermon, the Chief Imam of Ansarudeen Central Mosque, Ado Ekiti, Imam Abdullahi AbdulMutallib, urged the pensioners to build faith in God. He said, “He (God) will touch the hearts of those in government to attend to their needs.” In the same vein, Pastor Isaac Ojo urged the pensioners not to be discouraged by their present situation, saying that “God is able to intervene.”
