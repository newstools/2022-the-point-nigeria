 A group called YOCA has urged women vying for elective positions in the country to focus on impacting lives rather than money making if elected. Ms. Yanmo Adetula, Chief Executive Officer, YOCA, and  founder of Amplify Masterclass, on Tuesday in Abuja, observed that many women campaigning for elective offices want the position in a bid to amass wealth rather than having the desire to change the society. She said that female aspirants should not go into politics because of the money, but should contest because they want to serve, impact and transform lives. According to Adetula, the Masterclass is an empowering and mindset shifting interactive platform aimed at giving fresh interpretation and perspective to life. This, she noted, was to enable individuals to live authentically through practical application and dialogue. “Women aspirants should not run for elections for the money, they should go for serving people, impacting and transforming lives. Then, the money will follow. “Many of us want that position because of the money, not necessarily because we want to change the society. “This is why the Amplified  Masterclass talks about changing your mindset. If you can alter the way you think and you understand your purpose, you are more likely to get more positive results out of people,” Adetula said. She added that women needed to find something to do in line with who they are and not to be copycats that do things because other people did it as life was not a competition. “Women need to know that they have so much more in them. We can put up master class and workshops and all the different great initiatives but ultimately, we want women to know that they have a lot to offer. “So, being marginalised is not an excuse. If you understand your identity and you have a vision and your goals, then you will know what you need to do and start to focus on it.”
