 The Nigerian Red Cross Society, Lagos State Branch, says it members will on February 14 donate 1,000 pints of blood to Lagos State Government. The Chairman, Adebola Kolawole, told the News Agency of Nigeria on Sunday in Lagos, that the donation of the blood, which begun at its Makoko office on February 12 would end on February 14. Kolawole said the blood would be given to the Lagos State Blood Transfusion Service for accident victims. “In the spirit of Valentine’s season of celebrating love, the NRCS believes that one of the ways of expressing love is by giving life. “The blood is to save lives and we don’t know the lives we’re going to save by donating,” she said. She urged Lagos residents to take advantage of the opportunity because of the many benefits associated with donating blood. Kolawole said some of the benefits included saving up to three lives in one donation, stimulating production of more blood, opportunity for a checkup and detecting potential health problems for donors. The donation, being driven by the Red Cross NYSC Detachment and Youth Wing, is organised in collaboration with LSBTS. The Secretary of NRCS, Olakunle Lasisi, said the Red Cross had partnered with LSBTS for over 25 years to ensure that blood was readily available in its blood bank during emergencies. Lasisi said the blood donation was also to support Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State, in his efforts to save lives during emergencies. He urged youths to inculcate the habit of voluntary blood donation to reap it benefits. (NAN)
