 There was scare at Ajao Estate area of Lagos, on Tuesday, as a commercial bus driver reportedly sets himself ablaze in protest against the seizure of his vehicle by men of the Lagos State Traffic Management Authority. It was learnt that the driver, whose identity could not be immediately confirmed, was arrested for traffic infractions. Report had it that two LASTMA officials dragged him out of the vehicle to drive to their base at Oshodi. Those in the area alleged that the enraged driver poured fuel on himself and struck a stick of matches. Angry commercial bus drivers and conductors reportedly hauled stones at the LASTMA officials, thereby leading to confusion. Some drivers who were close to the scene rushed to move their vehicles away from the raging fire as others made efforts to save the burning driver An eyewitness was quoted as saying, “The LASTMA officials were attacked because they never cared about the victim that was on fire. Rather, they were more interested in moving the vehicle away. “The driver was eventually rushed to the hospital. Other drivers around said the victim lost his job last year and just got the commercial bus last November.” A commercial bus driver, who simply gave his name as Wadada, said, “LATSMA officials are treating us like slaves. They arrest and extort us at will. We go through hell in their hands and those of agberos and local government officials. How much do we make? “Out of the money we make daily, we will buy fuel, return money to the vehicle owners and at the end of the day, we are left with little or nothing. We are appealing to the state government to wade into the matter and save us from the hands of LASTMA officials.” Men of the Rapid Response Squad were reported to have saved the situation from turning bloodier by rescuing the LASTMA officials from mob attack.
