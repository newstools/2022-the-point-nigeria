 BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO A traditional ruler in Osun State, Olowu of Kuta, Oba Adekunle Makama, has raised the alarm about the infiltration of non-state actors stockpiling arms and ammunition at the instruction of some politicians across the state. The monarch, in a statement he personally signed on Friday in Osogbo, said he was disturbed by the activities of non-state actors who had infiltrated the state in order to perpetrate violence. The monarch maintained that despite his security consciousness, the actors infiltrated the state with arms and ammunition to foment trouble ahead of the Saturday’s primary election of the ruling All Progressives Congress. According to him, “the member representing Ayedire federal constituency in the House of Representatives and party executives in the local government were having a sensitization programme when some hoodlums, wielding dangerous weapons started shooting sporadically into the defenseless people without any provocation.” The monarch admonished politicians and their supporters to eschew violence, adding that it’s an ill wind that blows no one any good. He called on the law enforcement agencies in the state to double their effort and ensure that there is no break-down of law and order as the election draws nearer. Oba Makama also urged well meaning citizens of the state to join in the crusade so that those bent on causing violence would be fished out and made to face the full wrath of the law. “What happened in Kuta yesterday (Thursday) was shocking to everyone. It was the height of irresponsibility. We have never witnessed such brigandage in our area. More worrisome is that almost all the actors are known,” the monarch said.
