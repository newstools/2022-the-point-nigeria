He is a pride of the Black race. “When I told my friends and colleagues in the Council that His Royal Highness had initiated plans to visit me for my forthcoming birthday, many of them said, ‘In this Abeokuta? We have to give him a befitting welcome’.” In her remarks, Kolapo, Publisher of The Point, said, “HRH Muhammadu Sanusi II is humility personified.
