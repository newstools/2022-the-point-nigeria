A good house can keep them healthy, productive and free from adverse climate and all types of predators. Housing helps the pigs to keep warm during the winter season and cold temperatures. It also helps them to keep moderate temperatures during excessive heat in the summer season. Pigs are very sensitive to heat and they may become sick and die due to excessive heat or cold temperature. Controlled and moderate temperature can help to maximize the growth and production from the pig farming business. Pigs can be raised both indoors and in individual stalls, pens or barns. In the case of raising the pigs outdoors, they need a special type of shelter during hot and cold weather. Keep sufficient space for feeding and bedding inside the house. Pigs generally like dry beds. So, always try to keep the house and bed dry. Also make a suitable system for protecting from extreme humidity, heat and cold. For an indoor pig farming system, make proper and sufficient ventilation systems in the house. Ensure sufficient flow of fresh air and light inside the house. Make a proper drainage inside the house to keep the house dry. Good sanitation system inside the house is very important for pig farming. Make housing with good sanitation facilities so that you can easily clean the house. Feeding Feeding good quality, fresh and nutritious food can make your pigs healthier and ensure proper growth. Good food also helps to prevent various types of diseases.

Soybeans or cooked meat can be a great source of protein for the pigs. Pigs will grow faster, if you can get necessary nutrition elements, vitamins and other supplements.
Piglets require more protein than mature pigs. You can buy ready-made pig food from the market or make your own mixture prepared at home.
Along with providing nutritious and fresh food, always serve them a sufficient amount of clean and fresh water. Pigs require a huge amount of water daily. So, make a great source of clean and fresh water available in the farm area. Breeding Breeding process of pigs is easy and simple. Generally, the gestation period of pigs is not more than 115 days.
