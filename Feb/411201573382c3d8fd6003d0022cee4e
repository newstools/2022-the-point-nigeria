 The National Executive Council of the Academic Staff Union of Universities has voted to embark on one month warning strike to press home its demands with the Federal Government. Report had it that the warning strike was to ginger the government to do the needful. However, if adamant, the union would embark on an indefinite strike. A source within the union was quoted as saying that “We just want to give the government a long rope hoping that it would see the need to avoid a total paralysis of academic activities in the nation’s universities. “We are parents too and have our children in the system but we cannot watch and allow the total collapse of education in the country. “Our agitation is in the interest of all and if the system is made better, we will all enjoy it. Prominent personalities in the country have waded into the matter but the government seems recalcitrant. “Our National President would explain more when he briefs the press later today.” ASUU has been on the warpath with the Federal Government as it agitates for the payment of Earned Academic Allowance, revitalization fund, the replacement of the Integrated Personnel Payroll Information System with the University Transparency and Accountability System, among others.
