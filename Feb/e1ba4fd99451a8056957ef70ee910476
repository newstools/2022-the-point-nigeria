 BY MOYINOLUWA BAMIDELE-LUCAS The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, NDLEA, has vowed that no stone will be left unturned to ensure that embattled DCP Abba Kyari and four others now in its custody over alleged involvement in a 25 kilograms cocaine deal, would be made to face the full weight of the law if found culpable. The Director of Media and Advocacy in NDLEA Mr. Femi Babafemi, gave this assurance on Monday in a press statement while confirming that Kyari and others earlier declared wanted were already in the agency’s custody. He explained that the Nigeria Police Force handed the men over to NDLEA few hours after Kyari and his alleged accomplices were declared wanted. “Five of the wanted suspects namely – DCP Abba Kyari; ACP Sunday J. Ubua; ASP Bawa James; Inspector Simon Agirgba and Inspector John Nuhu – were driven into the national headquarters of NDLEA in Abuja at about 5pm on Monday, 14th February, to formally hand them over for interrogation and further investigation,” Babafemi said.
