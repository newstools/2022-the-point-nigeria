 About 400 people were arrested on Friday during the renewed demonstrations in Russia against the invasion of Ukraine, civil rights activists alleged. The civil rights portal, OVD-Info, registered protests in 17 Russian cities. Photos and videos, mainly from St Petersburg published on the social network Telegram, showed police officers suppressing the protests. Many Russians who feel a close bond with the Ukrainians due to family ties, turned out to show sympathy. Friday’s demonstrations were initially much smaller than the ones on Thursday when over 1,700 people were arrested in more than 40 cities. Russian authorities had previously issued an urgent warning against protests and threatened arrests. The authorities had repeatedly banned rallies, also citing the pandemic. (dpa/NAN).
