 Professor Banji Akintoye, leader of the Ilana Omo Oodua Worldwide, the umbrella body of the Yoruba self-determination groups, has urged the Yoruba people to keep the hope of actualizing the Yoruba Nation alive. Akintoye stated, on Saturday, that he would not be marking his 87th birthday when Chief Sunday Adeyemo (Sunday Igboho) was in detention. The renowned historian and Second Republic Senator spoke in a statement signed by the group’s Communications Secretary, Maxwell Adeleye. The statement quoted him as saying that “The Yoruba Nation is an idea whose time has come. “Today, I clock 87. I thank God for this unusual grace and favour. I am grateful to God for the strength, energy and good health that I am enjoying. “My message to the Yoruba people worldwide, who are passionate for the country of their own, is not to lose hope. “I am more than convinced that we are on our way to freedom. Our agitation is an idea whose time has come. We shall keep the struggle alive, and beyond the manipulation of the Nigerian government. “We won’t allow the Nigerian Government to criminalise our struggle. The Yoruba people worldwide are urged never to be deterred. “Many Yoruba patriots worldwide planned to celebrate my birthday but I pleaded with them not to do so in honour of my son and one of the heroes of our struggle, Chief Sunday Adeyemo, fondly called Sunday Ighoho. I cannot be celebrating a birthday when Ighoho is in detention.”
