 BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO Goods and property worth millions of naira have been destroyed in a midnight fire incident that occurred at Atakumosa central market, Ilesa, Osun State. It was gathered that the fire outbreak started at the Post Office section of the market in the early hours of Sunday. Men and officers of the Federal and Osun State Fire Service made frantic efforts to prevent the fire from spreading to other parts of the market, an eyewitness said. The combined team of men and officers from Ayeso A’ Division and Ijamo B’ Division was on ground to prevent looting during the rescue mission as shop owners and sympathizers made efforts to salvage some goods. Though the fire was brought under control around 4:00am, an officer of the state fire service who preferred anonymity said the cause was yet to be ascertained. Among the goods destroyed were clothes, food stuff and provisions. Some of the affected traders wept profusely when they got to the scene of the inferno as their relations were sighted, assisting them to remove the debris at their burnt shops.
