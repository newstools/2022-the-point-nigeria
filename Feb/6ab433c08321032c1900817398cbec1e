 Report has confirmed that Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom has tested positive for COVID-19. She was said to have been down with ‘cold-like symptoms.’ BBC quoted Buckingham Palace as saying that she was expected to carry out light duties this week. AP said that the palace indicated that the 95-year-old British monarch would continue with light duties at Windsor Castle over the coming week. “She will continue to receive medical attention and will follow all the appropriate guidelines,” the palace said in a statement. The queen has received three jabs of coronavirus vaccine. Both her eldest son, Prince Charles and daughter-in-law Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, recently contracted COVID-19, but Charles had since returned to work. Britain’s longest-reigning monarch, the queen, reached the milestone of 70 years on the throne on February 6.
