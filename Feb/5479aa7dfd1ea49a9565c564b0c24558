 BY BENEDICT NWACHUKWU, ABUJA Ahead of the Osun state governorship election coming up in July this year, Governor Gboyega Oyetola is currently undergoing screening at the Buhari House national secretariat of the All Progressives Congress in Abuja. The governor who stormed the party’s national secretariat in a grand style with a crowd of followers singing and dancing has been speaking on why he believes he should be given yet another opportunity to run the state. He was at the same venue on Thursday last week to submit his expression of interest form when he told newsmen that he has delivered the dividends of democracy in the areas of education, health, agriculture as well as general improvement on the welfare of the people. He said despite the paucity of funds in the state, he was able to achieve so much by thinking outside the box by looking inwards and also due to frugal management of resources. He however noted that the successes would not have been possible without the support of members of his cabinet. The governor did not mince words when he declared that the APC as the ruling party still remains the party to beat in the state as the crowd of supporters that accompanied him to Abuja attest to his claim. “I want to tell you that the people of Osun are very happy with us, they appreciate the much we have been able to do despite the meager financial base of the state. So with that in mind, I dare say that the APC still remains the party to beat in the state. “We have touched lives in the areas of agriculture by empowering small scale agro based farmers, we have empowered young people by training the in skill acquisition programmes and also giving them start-ups to help them establish their own businesses.” Recall that in 2018, Oyetola had to rely on a supplementary election to defeat his closest challenger, Senator Ademola Adeleke of the Peoples Democratic Party.
