 Facts have emerged that the DIG Joseph Egbuniike panel has recommended the demotion of Abba Kyari, Commander of IRT, a DCP to the rank of Assistant Commissioner of Police. Kyari’s latest investigation followed the rejection and the return of the investigation report of the Special Investigation Panel which earlier probed his involvement in the $1.1million Hushpuppi internet fraud scam and the directive by the Police Service Commission to the Force headquarters to conduct a fresh investigation. The panel found Kyari culpable of fraternizing with fraudulent characters in violation of the NPF professional ethics. The SIP also found him culpable of violating the social media policy of the Nigeria Police Force for responding to the FBI’s indictment on his Facebook page without recourse to laid down procedures. “The evidence of bribe is circumstantial since it was not proven that the bribe was paid into the officer’s account nor was any proceeds of the bribe traced by the panel much less linking the officer to any such proceeds,’’ the SIP said. An advice from the office of the Attorney-General of the Federation on Kyari read that “There exists a prima facie case of conspiracy, collaboration, receipt, conversion, transfer and/or retention of proceeds of unlawful activities contrary to the provision of Section 15, 17 & 18 of the Money Laundering (Prohibition) Act, 2004 and Section 17 of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (Est) Act, Cap EI Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004 against DCP Abba Kyari and other suspects in view of the overwhelming evidence showing the nature of his disguised financial transactions and activities Ramon Abbas (Hushpuppi) and others.”
