 Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, on Wednesday in Owerri, the Imo State capital, castigated the All Progressives Congress on its postponed national convention, saying that a party that cannot organise its convention lacks the ability to rule the country. Governor Wike spoke at the grand reception organised to celebrate the National Secretary of the Peoples Democratic Party, Senator Samuel Anyanwu, by the PDP in Imo State at the Kanu Nwankwo Sports Complex, Owerri. A statement by his Special Assistant on Media, Kelvin Ebiri, quoted Wike as saying that the inability demonstrated by the APC was a proof for Nigerians to deny the APC a place of governance both at the federal and state levels in 2023. “Nigerians are angry because the party (APC) at the national level is a failure. It’s a failure to the point that it is ruling Nigeria with tension. Ordinarily, to sign the Electoral Act, they keep on postponing it everyday and Nigerians are tired. “A party that cannot hold a national convention, is it a party that can rule Nigeria? Ordinary convention, a party in power cannot hold. Look at how we did our own. That is to tell you that PDP is the party that should rule Nigeria. This is the party that will rule Imo State too,” the statement read. It enjoined members of the PDP in Imo State not to succumb to intimidation, adding, “The only mistake that we will make is for us not to work together, and we will not make that mistake. “Now, all of us must unite. If there is no party, there will be no governor. If there is no party, there will be no president. “Let nobody fear, nobody can intimidate us. All that time has passed when somebody that carried fourth will come first. It will never happen again. “If you want us to take back Imo State in the next election, all of us must work together. We are ready to support you to take back Imo State.”
