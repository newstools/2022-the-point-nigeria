 President Muhammadu Buhari will, on Tuesday, meet with governors of the ruling All Progressives Congress at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. Earlier, the meeting was scheduled to hold last Tuesday but was put off shortly before the President traveled to Brussels, Belgium to attend the EU-AU Summit. It was gathered that the rescheduled meeting with the APC governors, at the instance of President Buhari, would look at the national convention of the party scheduled to hold on Saturday, February 26. The meeting, to be led by Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State, is expected to have 20 other APC governors in attendance. The coming meeting would discuss possible date for the party’s convention and other logistics for approval by President Buhari.
