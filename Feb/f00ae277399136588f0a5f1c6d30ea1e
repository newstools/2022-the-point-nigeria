 BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO Some residents of Osun State have cried out over increasing activities of thugs in some towns and villages across the state. The aggrieved residents called on the state government, security agencies, traditional rulers and other concerned stakeholders to save them from the endless extortion and harassment by the thugs. Findings by The Point revealed that the hoodlums, whose number continues to swell, are more concentrated in Osogbo, Ilesa and Ile-Ife and environs. The thugs are said to be notorious for extorting prospective house owners, as they go round various construction sites, especially in the state capital to demand for money from potential landlords. They demand for amounts ranging from N20, 000 to N300, 000, depending on the size of the structures, land and status of the house owners. Recently, residents said that the thugs took their activities to a higher level by also engaging in daylight robbery. Their biggest targets, they alleged, were suspected internet fraudsters popularly known as ‘Yahoo boys.’ Investigations revealed that the hoodlums now use the Point of Sales Machine to extort their victims as many people no longer take raw cash. Checks by our correspondent revealed that the touts operate at places such as Egbatedo, Kolawole, Atelewo, River Side, Obalende, Arikalamu, Idi-Omo and Orita Ahmadiyyah in Osogbo. It was learnt that some of the hoodlums often disguise themselves as commercial motorcycle operators (okada men), take unsuspecting passengers to isolated areas where other gang members are waiting to extort them. A student of the Osun State Polytechnic, Iree who is currently undergoing Industrial Work Experience Scheme, in Osogbo, claimed that he fell victim of the hoodlums at Egbatedo area of Osogbo in January.
