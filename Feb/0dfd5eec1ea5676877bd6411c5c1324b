 BY AGNES NWORIE, ABAKALIKI Governor of Imo State, Hope Uzodimma, has said the election of Blyden Amajuruonwu, candidate of the All Progressives Congress, in the just concluded by-election for the Ngor-Okpala State Constituency signaled the liberation of the constituents from many years of political bondage. The Governor spoke on Sunday at the Government House Chapel Owerri where he expressed gratitude to all those who participated in the campaign and election that produced Amajuronwu as  another APC member in the Imo State House of Assembly. Governor Uzodimma said the Ngor Okpala by-election was very important because the people have stayed too long without a voice at the State House of Assembly. He therefore thanked God “for liberating the people of Ngor Okpala from the hands of those who have held them hostage for a long time.” “I thank God for life, for his love and for victory, and I congratulate Imo people for the good health we have continued to receive from God.” The Governor also expressed his thanks to the security Agencies in Imo State “for always rising to the occasion in the face of difficulties to ensure they bring relative peace and calm to the state.” Governor Uzodimma who was elated at the outcome of the Ngor Okpala election, recalled how APC, under his watch, recorded victory in past by-elections that saw Miriam Onuoha and Frank Ibezim of the Okigwe North Federal Constituency and Imo North Senatorial Zone elected. “Ngor Okpala people understood the message that they have been deceived for a long time and decided to take their faith and destiny in their own hands.”
