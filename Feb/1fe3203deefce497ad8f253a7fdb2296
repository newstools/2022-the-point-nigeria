 BY AKINWALE ABOLUWADE All indigenes of Ibadan at home and abroad have been asked to rally round the incoming Olubadan, Senator Lekan Balogun, to fully explore his wealth of experience and rich exposure for the progress, growth and development of Ibadanland. The Agbaakin Bobagunwa of Ibadanland, Tajudeen Olugbode, made the call on Saturday his congratulatory visit to Balogun. While expressing joy on the nomination of Dr. Balogun as the next Olubadan following the demise of Oba Saliu Adetunji, he said the Ibadans at home and in the diaspora could not have wished for anything different. Olugbode said, “We are thankful to the Almighty Allah that what looked like skirmishes at the beginning of the nomination process of the new Olubadan were amicably resolved and everything went according to original laid down succession plan. “Having achieved that with peace and tranquility now pervading the land and Ibadans producing the most educated Oba in history with robust political, administrative and business experience, we need to rally round him so that his rich credentials would come to bear on his reign. “Our new Oba needs us around him to offer advise and suggestions on how to make Ibadan great under his reign. “I’m very happy to hear him saying he would operate an open door-policy and be a listening father to all. That’s the kind of monarch we need and that’s why I’m calling on my compatriots to move closer to the monarch and avail him of our humble contributions towards the advancement of our father land.” In his response, Balogun urged him as well as others to let all about Ibadan be their concern for the good of the land.
