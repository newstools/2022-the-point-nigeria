 A 37-year-old driver, Emmanuel Okolie, on Tuesday appeared before an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court for allegedly damaging the engine of a bus valued at N1.9 million. Okolie, a resident of College Road, Ogba, Lagos State, is being charged for damaging and stealing the engine. The Prosecution Counsel, ASP Clifford Ogu, told the court that the offences were committed on December 20, 2021 along Ijaiye Road in Lagos State. He said that the defendant maliciously damaged the engine of a Toyota Hiace (commercial) bus, valued at N1.9 million, property of Godstand Transport and Logistics. “The defendant willfully damaged the bus by pouring salt inside the engine, which caused an engine knock,” Ogu said, adding that he (the defendant) also stole the complainant’s N80,000. “The defendant, who was sent to drop passengers in Owerri, refused to remit the money for that day. “The case was reported, leading to the arrest of the defendant,” the prosecutor said. The offences contravene sections 287(7) and 350 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. The News Agency of Nigeria reports that Section 287(7) prescribes seven-year-jail-term for stealing from an employer while Section 350 attracts two years for the alleged damage. Following his not guilty plea, Magistrate S. K. Matepo, released the defendant on bail of N200,000 with two sureties in like sum. Matepo said that the sureties should be gainfully employed and must show evidence of two-year-tax-payment to the Lagos State Government. The magistrate fixed further hearing in the case for March 1. (NAN).
