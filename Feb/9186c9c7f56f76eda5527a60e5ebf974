 The US Mission has expanded its visa services to assist non-immigrant visa applicants in Nigeria who qualify to renew their visa. The Consulate stated that the new application procedure would begin in February at its Lagos office. However, the number of qualified applicants who can apply via the new procedures would be limited in the first phase. The Consulate stated that the processing might take up to two months. The US Mission added that the application procedure would also be extended to the US Embassy in Abuja at a later date. “Applicants who meet the criteria may apply in Lagos until the service is extended to Abuja. “Please, note that only one member of the family unit is required to drop-off the application documents; children are not required to come drop-off in person. “Processing may take up to two months. Although we anticipate most cases will be processed within a few weeks, once you submit your travel documents, we will be unable to return these to you until your case has been completed.”
