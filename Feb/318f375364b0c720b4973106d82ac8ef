 BY VICTORIA ONU, ABUJA The Securities and Exchange Commission has reaffirmed that it is committed to making the capital market attractive to Nigerians of all ages and positions. The Director-General of the SEC, Lamido Yuguda, stated this during a meeting with a team led by the British Deputy High Commissioner in Abuja. Yuguda in a statement on Sunday said the Commission is implementing various initiatives to ensure that products and offerings in the market are accessible to both the young and old which he said would further deepen the market. According to him, “When we assumed office, we were shocked to know that the average age of the Central Securities Clearing System account holder was over 50 years. The CSCS is a depository so if you are investing in equities you must have a CSCS account. “The average age of that account holder was over 50, and that made us realize that the young people were not participating in this market and when young people are not participating in any market, that market is doomed to fail. “Young people today prefer to do things on their phones, if you have to fill a stack of forms manually young people won’t do it. We want to make investing in the capital market a fun experience. “The capital market experience starts with a bank account and eventually the distribution has to hit a bank account as well. So, we decided to look at the whole process and find out what is turning young people off.
