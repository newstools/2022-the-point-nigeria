 A 50-year-old man, Daniyan Ojo, has reportedly set his wife on fire in a fit of anger. Ojo allegedly locked up his wife,  Dorcas, in her room while asleep and set their house at their Irese Road residence, Shagari Village, Akure, on fire. She was rushed to the hospital after being rescued. However, it was learnt that the woman died due to the degree of burns after receiving medical attention for about 72 hours. It was also learnt that the husband got infuriated after discovering that his wife secretly bought a property without his knowledge. Ojo, who is now standing trial before the court, however, denied the allegation that he set his wife’s room on fire or locked her inside the room. The prosecution counsel, led by H.M Falowo, said that the defendant was standing trial over allegations of arson, murder and disabling to commit a felony. He was also alleged to have disabled the only means of escape (door) by the victim prior to his action. A witness, Ajayi Ajiboye, told the court that he heard the defendant calling for help. “When I got to the compound, l discovered that her room was on fire and I forcefully broke the door with my leg. “The following morning, landlords in the neighbourhood came to the house and discovered empty bottles of petroleum products scattered under the victim’s bed positioned at strategic corners of the room.” Another neighbour, Ogunsola Babatunde, stated that he heard an alarm raised in the defendant’s compound and went there to ascertain the cause of the uproar. “I met the other landlords there. We all heard the victim shouting, ‘it was my husband who packed cotton at the point where the fire ignited from.’ The victim later died in the hospital due to the degree of burns.” Inspector Bayo Adaran said that a case of arson and murder was transferred from Okuta Elerinla Police Division to the State CID for further investigation.
