 A man simply identified as Dennis was reportedly killed as 10 persons were abducted by gunmen at a train station in Ajaokuta, Kogi State on Monday. It was learnt that the incident occurred around 2pm while on his way to pick his boss from work. Dennis reportedly gave up the ghost as the gunmen opened fire on him. At least, 10 persons, mainly residents of the Ajaokuta village waiting for train to arrive, were reported to have been whisked away to an unknown destination by the abductors. A villager was reported as saying that the kidnappers called to demand N20 million ransom from their victims’ families. A resident of Ajaokuta called Dele Ajala, said, “The latest kidnap has plunged some of the victim’s family into sorrow. “This goes to show how insecure the country is. There is a need to reinforce the state with adequate police officers to counter this kind of issue. Robbery and kidnapping have now become legal businesses in the country.” The Police Public Relations Officer, Kogi State Command, William Ovye Aya, said that the police had yet to be briefed on the incident.
