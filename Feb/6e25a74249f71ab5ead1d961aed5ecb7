 A Magistrates’ Court sitting in Kaduna, on Monday, ordered that a 29-year-old tailor, Gado Yahaya, should be remanded in a correctional centre for allegedly killing his neighbour. Yahaya, a resident of Rigasa in Kaduna State, is standing trial for culpable homicide. The Chief Magistrate, Ibrahim Emmanuel, turned down the plea of the defendant for bail on the ground that the court lacked jurisdiction to hear the matter. Emmanuel directed the police to forward the defendant’s case file to the State Director of Public Prosecution for legal advice. He adjourned the matter till March 9 for mention. Earlier, the Police prosecutor, Insp. Chidi Leo, alleged that the deceased (Liman Salisu), a neighbour to the defendant, had an argument with him over a bucket of water which resulted in a fist fight. “In the course of the fight, the defendant went into the kitchen, picked a pestle and hit the deceased on his head. “The deceased slumped after the hit on the head and died on the way to the hospital. “The defendant had written and signed a confessional statement when brought to the police station for questioning,” Leo said. He added that the offence contravened the provisions of Section 190 of the Penal Code of Kaduna State, 2017. (NAN).
