 BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO The Department of State Security, Osun State command, has arraigned a man, Bunmi Odeyemi, before an Osogbo Magistrate’s Court for allegedly parading himself in the public as a medical doctor and also attending to ailing patients. Odeyemi, aged 39, was accused of conspiring with others now at large, between December, 2018 and January, 2022, to render medical services to unsuspecting members of the public. Counsel to the DSS, B. O. Nweke, informed the court that the defendant defrauded an unsuspecting patient, Gift Nkechi Akinloye, to the tune of N330, 000 under the guise of rendering medical services to her. The charge against him read that “Bunmi Odeyemi, between December, 2018 and January, 2022, with fraudulent intent, falsely held yourself out to members of the public as a qualified medical doctor when, in fact, you are not so qualified. “That you (defendant), between the months of October and November, 2020 within the jurisdiction of the court, did defraud one Gift Nkechi Akinloye to the tune of N330, 000, under the guise of rendering medical services to her at your unlicensed clinic located at Isale General, Ilesa.” The DSS prosecutor said that the accused person committed offences contrary to and punishable under sections 516, 484 and 419 of Criminal Code Cap, 34, Volume 2, Laws of Osun State of Nigeria, 2002.
Odeyemi pleaded not guilty to the three-count-charge slammed against him. The defence counsel, Tunbosun Oladipupo, applied for the defendant’s bail in liberal terms. Magistrate A. A. Adebayo granted Odeyemi bail in the sum of N500, 000 with one surety in the same amount. The surety, he said, must reside within the jurisdiction of the court and should produce a valid national identity card, with utility bill. The matter was adjourned till March 28 for mention.
