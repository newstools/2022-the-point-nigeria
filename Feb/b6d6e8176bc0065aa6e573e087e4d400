 BY AGNES NWORIE, ABAKALIKI Two more seats have been declared vacant in the Ebonyi State House of Assembly as the crisis in the House intensifies. This brought the number of seats declared vacant within two days to three. Recall that the seat of the Deputy Speaker, Odefa Obasi, was declared vacant at plenary on Tuesday leading to his replacement by Kingsley Ikoro. The seats of the embattled lawmaker representing Ivo Constituency and his counterpart representing Afikpo North East Constituency, Oliver Osi and Lilian Ngozi Eziulo, respectively were newly declared vacant by the Assembly. Ikoro, citing Section 306 Sub- Section 2 and 7 of 1999 Nigerian Constitution (as amended), said that the seats of the two lawmakers were declared vacant following their defection letters from PDP to APC. However, the 15 APC lawmakers in the Assembly had described the development as grievous insult to the House, saying that they would turn to court for justice.
