 The Kaduna State Government says it identified 10,901 tuberculosis patients in the state in December 2021 and placed them on treatment. The Programme Manager of the state Tuberculosis, Leprosy and Buruli Ulcer Control Programme, Dr Abubakar Sadiq, made the disclosure in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria, on Wednesday, in Kaduna. He said that this indicated an increase of about 86 per cent when compared with the 5,878 cases detected in the year 2020. He acknowledged the support received from the National Tuberculosis and Leprosy Control Programme, the state government and various partners. “The state government has procured five mobile diagnostic trucks equipped with digital X-ray machines and 10 colour gene Xpert machines for the integrated diagnosis of tuberculosis, COVID-19 and various other diseases in remote communities across the state. “With the procurement of this equipment, the detection of tuberculosis cases will be facilitated, hence the increase in number of patients,” he said. Sadiq said that the state government intended to intensify efforts at detecting cases through increased access to services, out-door patients’ screening and tuberculosis patients contact investigation, among others. He called on residents to support the state to enhance the identification of all tuberculosis cases in communities with a view to eliminating the disease. “Remember, any cough that lasts two weeks or more could be tuberculosis; diagnosis and treatment are free and are widely available across the state. “Again, tuberculosis is treatable and curable,” he said.
