 The Supreme Court on Friday declared that the Executive Order 10 on the funding of State Judiciary and Legislature is unlawful and unconstitutional. In a split decision on Friday, the majority of the court’s seven-member panel agreed that the President exceeded his constitutional powers in issuing the EO10. The judgment was on the suit filed by the 36 States against the FG on the funding of the Judiciary and the constitutionality of the EO10. Six out of the seven members of the panel proceeded to void and set aside the EO10. The majority decision also held that it was not the responsibility of the Federal Government to fund the capital and recurrent expenditures of the courts created for States under Section six of the Constitution.
