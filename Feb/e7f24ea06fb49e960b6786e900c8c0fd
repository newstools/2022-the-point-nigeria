 The governor of Kogi State, Yahaya Bello, has approved the implementation of N30,000 minimum wage for the state civil servants with partial consequential adjustment. The new wage affects both the state and local government workforce. Dr Folashade Ayoade, Secretary to the Kogi State Government, made the disclosure after an extensive meeting with the Organised Labour in Lokoja, on Tuesday. According to the SSG, the delay in the implementation is due to the inability of the Committee to meet regularly in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. She lauded the organised labour for their understanding and patience which, she said, resulted in the signing of the implementation of the new minimum wage. The Deputy Governor, Chief Edward Onoja, expressed appreciation to the workers for their understanding and commitment. Onoja said that Governor Yahaya Bello was passionate about the welfare of civil servants and would continue to accord priority attention to them. The Head of the State Civil Service, Hannah Odiyo, said that with the signing of the agreement on the new national minimum wage, the committee had completed its work without recourse to industrial action. The state Chairman of the Nigeria Labour Congress, Onuh Edoka, said that Kogi State civil servants had been brought to the same level with their counterparts in other states. “The earlier notice of strike served on the state government has been suspended with immediate effect. “We commend the state government for signing the agreement with the mandate of immediate implementation to give civil servants in the state a new lease of life. “We assure of civil servants’ commitment to effective productivity in all sectors of the economy.” Present at the signing of the agreement was the state Chairman of the Trade Union Congress, Ranti Ojo; state Chairman of NUJ, Adeiza Momoh-Jimoh; and Chairman, NULGE, Tade Adeyemi, among others.
