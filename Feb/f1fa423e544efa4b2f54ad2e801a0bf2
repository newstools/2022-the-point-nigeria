 An Igbo organisation, AlaIgbo Development Foundation, has tasked its leaders on the need to remain committed to their demand for Igbo Presidency as electioneering draws close. The foundation stated that it was the turn of Ndigbo to produce the next president of Nigeria, while also restating its support for the agitation. The President-General of ADF,  Prof. Uzodinma Nwala, lamented the marginalization of Ndigbo in Nigeria, making reference to the alleged enforcement of the Igbo youth to take the COVID-19 vaccination while their Northern counterparts were not compelled to take the jab. Nwala was quoted as saying, “ADF has noted with regret the ongoing imposition of COVID vaccination/injection on Igbo youths especially students writing examinations or seeking employment into Federal establishments. “It has come to our notice that the youths of the Northern states have been insulated from these vaccinations. In fact, a particular Traditional ruler in the North was reported to have charged the youth to deal ruthlessly with anyone who tries to vaccinate them. “It is common knowledge that some European countries have rejected the vaccines and we wonder why the Igbo youths or any youth in Nigeria should become instrument of genocidal experimentation. “It is the considered view of the ADF that Ndigbo should change their political strategy in our quest for self-determination. In the light of the current state of insecurity and anarchy enveloping Alaigbo in particular and Nigeria in general, we present a new strategy based on the use of ballot for effecting social/political change. “There is the need for Ndigbo to appreciate the impact and potency of the ballot in a power struggle. We should stop opposing elections. This strategy is intended to mobilize all pan-Igbo and pro-Biafran organisations to adopt the ballot as a critical force in our struggle for self-determination.”
