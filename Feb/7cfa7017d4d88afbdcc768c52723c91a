 BY AKINWALE ABOLUWADE, IBADAN Governor Seyi Makinde of
Oyo State, on Saturday, said that he would name the new Olubadan of Ibadanland on Monday. Makinde gave the indication at the final burial rites of the late Olubadan of Ibadanland, Oba Saliu Adetunji, who died on January 2. The governor stated that the emergence of the new Olubadan was in line with the laid-down tradition of the town, saying that issues surrounding the Olubadan stool had been sorted. He said, “I must sincerely thank God for a day like this because what we really hoped for is exactly what is happening here today.
The last respect we are paying for our late father today shows that Baba lived a good life. “When the crisis of the Obaship in Ibadanland started, I was right here in the Liberty Stadium and said that if there is any division or faction in the land, I will pitch my tent with the king. “Today, I am also happy that the crisis we have been witnessing on the issue of Olubadan stool has been settled. God has really taken control of everything. “I have received a letter from the Olubadan- in-Council and by the grace of God, on Monday, I will make the official announcement of the new Olubadan of Ibadanland on. “This is another victory for Ibadan traditional institution. The process and the system were never broken. I can say that we have now returned to our normal way of installing a new monarch in Ibadanland. Now, it is a system that everyone wants to imitate, which shows how we set the pace in Oyo State. “When the person who came to represent the Chief of Imam was praying, he appealed that we should take care of all that Baba left before he joined his ancestors.” The ceremony was witnessed by traditional rulers, members of the Central Council of Ibadan, Indigenes, Islamic and Christian leaders, clerics, pressure groups, political officeholders and a host of others.
