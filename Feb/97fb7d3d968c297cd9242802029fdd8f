 Facts have emerged that the Federal Government’s Information and Communications Technology service provider, Galaxy Backbone, is currently challenged by an issue which affects the servers being hosted on its platform. This is contrary to the belief that the National Identity Number verification portal of the National Identity Management Commission crashed. The management of the ICT company was said to have admitted that the fault was from them and allegedly apologised for the breakdown of the central server, leading to the suspension of services. The organisation stated that efforts were on to address the hiccups within the shortest possible time. It reassured the public that the highest priority classification of professional engineers across the organisation had been dispatched to fix the glitch. Chidi Okpala, Head, Corporate Communications, Galaxy Backbone, said that the company had put together a highly-skilled technical team of experienced engineers and applications experts to address the logjam and to ensure that such an incident did not reoccur in the future. He said, “In the meantime, we have reached out to all our valued customers and will continue to do so to provide the necessary updates required until all the services affected are completely restored. “The Management of Galaxy Backbone Limited regrets the temporary outage of some of its services and the inconvenience being experienced by some of its customers across the country. “Across the organisation, the highest priority classification has been assigned and all hands are on deck to ensure resolution is achieved within the shortest possible time.”
