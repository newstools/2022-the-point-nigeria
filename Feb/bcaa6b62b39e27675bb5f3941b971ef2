 Ahmed Buhari, a former presidential aspirant of the Sustainable National Party of Nigeria, on Monday, debunked claims that the South-East may not be able to present capable hands for presidency in the 2023 poll, listing Anyim Pius Anyim, Orji Kalu and Rochas Okorocha as possible candidates. Buhari, in an interview on Arise Television, Monday morning, said that every section of the country had reputable individuals who could pilot the affairs of the country if given the opportunity. He said that it would be fair if the next president was zoned to the South. Noting that in 2015, the North clamoured for power shift to the North after Goodluck Jonathan, he said it was the same argument in 2015 that produced President Mohammed Buhari, a Northerner to fill the slot of the North after Jonathan from the South-South. He wondered why the same people who clamour for power shift then to the North opposed power shift to the South at this time. He said that for the sake of equity and fairness, the presidential slot should further be zoned to South-East once ceded to the South, “because South-East is the only zone in the entire South that has not produced the president of Nigeria since the advent of Democracy in 1999.” He recalled that Anyim’s performance in the Senate as its president when the National Assembly was in turmoil, marked him out as one who could be entrusted with leadership.
