 BY BENEDICT NWACHUKWU, ABUJA The senator representing the Federal Capital Territory, Philip Aduda, has yet to show up at his 004 Polling Unit, Old Chief Palace Ward, Karu in the Abuja Municipal Area Council as the councils elections get underway. On the displayed voter’s list, the name of the senator was missing while that of his wife, Aduda, was on the list. According to voters at the PU 004 who spoke with The Point, Unit 004, Old Chief’s Palace, is the senator’s ward. The voters expressed confidence that the senator and his wife would come to vote. “Our senator will come to vote. This is his polling unit. He cannot afford to shun the election because he needs the people,” they said. Accreditation and voting began at 9:40am and would end at 2:30pm. A total of 2,850 voters registered at the polling unit but only 2,800 ballot papers were brought. The Presiding Officer, Anyanwu Nnaemeka, said that the process had been peaceful so far.
