 The inhabitants of Olomoro community in Isoko South Local Government Area of Delta State were, on Monday, thrown into grieve as a suspected ritualist reportedly hacked an elderly woman to death. It was gathered that the victim, whose identity had yet to be ascertained at press time, was killed while sleeping at her residence in Ukoli quarters. Sources said that the woman was found in a pool of blood in the early hours of today with some vital parts of her body missing. Some angry women reportedly thronged the streets in the community in protest against the gruesome murder of the octogenarian. “The woman was killed this morning and the community is accusing a boy of killing her because they found the woman’s handbag in his possession. “On seeing the bag with him, they beat the boy to stupor. In the process, the police came and put the situation under control,” a source who craved anonymity, said. Another resident of the community said, “It is painful that these days, people can no longer sleep with two eyes closed because of killings here and there majorly for ritual purposes. Government can no longer guarantee citizens security of lives and property.” Confirming the incident, the Police Public Relations Officer in the Command, Bright Edafe, said, “A woman was killed but none of her body part was missing.” He said that the police had deposited the woman’s body in the morgue, adding that “From what we discovered, the suspect that killed the woman is mentally deranged.”
