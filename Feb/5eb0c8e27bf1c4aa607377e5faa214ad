 Dele Momodu, a presidential aspirant of the Peoples Democratic Party for the 2023 elections, has expressed his resolve to bail out the citizens from the precipice by wresting power from the grip of the ruling All Progressives Congress. Momodu said that it would be counterproductive to rest the destiny of Nigerians on the shoulders of bad leadership by the
APC. The publisher of the Ovation Magazine spoke during a visit to his mother’s graveside in Gbongan and the palace of Olufi of Gboganland, Oba Adetoyese Oyeniyi, to kick-start his presidential ambition. At the palace, Momodu disclosed that he decided to run on the platform of the PDP to wrest power from the APC having played a critical role in bringing the party to power in 2015. He said that he was better prepared for the country’s topmost political seat and was determined not to give up on his ambition for someone “who thinks he can buy the whole of Nigeria with his money.” Momodu said, “I have been greatly humbled by the excitement already generated which reminds me of how it was 29 years ago when your good friend, my adopted father, Chief Moshood Abiola, threw his hat in the ring. “It is very obvious that Nigerians are eager to restore that promise of hope and the accompanying peace and joy that we lost.” Explaining that his political experience placed him in a vantage position to provide quality leadership, Momodu said that Nigeria required an urgent reset and total redirection. He said, “I have worked with late Chief Moshood Abiola during which I was forced into exile. I worked with Olu Falae and I was jailed for seeking the enthronement of democracy. I have also worked with President Muhammadu Buhari before things started working upside down.” Oba Oyeniyi, assuring Momodu of maximum support over his presidential ambition, lauded him for his courage and sense of patriotism.
