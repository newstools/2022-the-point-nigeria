 BY MAYOWA SAMUEL The Court of Appeal in Abuja has invalidated the judgment of a lower court which upheld the parallel congresses of All Progressives Congress conducted by the G-7 faction of the party led by Senator Ibrahim Shekarau. With the appeal court ruling, Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje has finally retained the supremacy to control the state structure of APC under the leadership of Abdullahi Abbas. The Ibrahim Shekarau-led faction approached the FCT High Court, Abuja, shortly after the APC congresses in Kano during which the court upheld the group’s congresses, as against that of the governor Ganduje-led side. Not satisfied with the High Court ruling, Ganduje’s group headed to the Appeal Court to contest the ruling. In its judgment delivered on Thursday, the appeal court insisted that the Federal high court, FCT division lacks the jurisdiction to sit on the APC ward and local government council congresses which recognized Haruna Ahmadu Danzago as party chairman. The appellate court also held that the case was not a pre-election matter but an internal matter of the ruling party, and therefore should be decided by the leadership of APC. The appeal court thereby upheld the prayers of the appellants (Ganduje faction) to recognize the existing leadership of the party and discountenance the lower court ruling.
