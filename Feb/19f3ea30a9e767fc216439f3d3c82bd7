 BY AGNES NWORIE, ABAKALIKI The representative of Ikwo/Ezza Federal Constituency of Ebonyi State at the National Assembly, Chinedu Ogah, has given succour to 17 rescued teenage indigenes of the state who were allegedly trafficked to Ogun State for drug peddling, hawking and prostitution. The 17 trafficked teenagers were said to have hailed from villages in Ikwo and Ezza South local government areas of Ebonyi State. While handing over the trafficked victims to the Ministry of Women Affairs and Social Development in Ebonyi State, Ogah stated that they were lured and trafficked to Agbara in Ogun State. Ogah gave scholarships to some of the victims who indicated interest in having formal education while others were enrolled for free skill acquisition programmes, based on their interest. It was gathered that the lawmaker also presented an undisclosed amount of money for their upkeeps, saying that “I got the news of child trafficking of Ebonyians in Ogun State. When I learnt of it, I alerted the Ikwo Town Union in Lagos State. “They abandoned their businesses and mobilised to Ogun State where they spent up to two weeks to locate the children. “These children are from Ikwo, Ezza South, and other parts of Ebonyi State. Based on the foundation that the governor, David Umahi, has laid, it is our duty to contribute our quota to making sure we care for the welfare of our people.”
