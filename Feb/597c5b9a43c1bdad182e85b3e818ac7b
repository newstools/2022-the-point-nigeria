 Senator Hassan Muhammad Gusau has been nominated by Governor Bello Matawalle of Zamfara State as his new deputy. This followed the impeachment of the erstwhile Deputy Governor, Aliyu Gusau, on Wednesday by the Zamfara State House of Assembly. Until his appointment, Gusau was a Senator representing Zamfara Central Senatorial District at the National Assembly. The Senator had in June 2021 resigned his membership of the opposition Peoples’ Democratic Party. His resignation was conveyed in a letter addressed to the President of the Senate and read during the start of plenary on June 29, 2021. Gusau had explained in the letter that his “decision is necessitated due to the collapse of internal democracy and factionalisation of the party from ward levels in Zamfara State. “Further decisions on political movement and party affiliations will be communicated to this chamber in due course.” He was born on December 12, 1960.
