Proffers solution to raging ritual killing  BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO A Yoruba socio cultural group, the Agbekoya Society of Nigeria, has called for the immediate and unconditional release of a Yoruba activist, Sunday Adeyemi, popularly known as Sunday Igboho. The Agbekoya Worldwide, led by its President General, Kamorudeen Okiki Aremu, staged a peaceful rally in Osogbo, capital of Osun State on Thursday, and asked President Muhammadu Buhari led Federal Government to ensure the release and repatriation of Igboho to Nigeria from Cotonou, Benin Republic. When the crowd of the Agbekoya warriors stormed the palace of the Ataoja of Osogbo, Oba Jimoh Olanipekun, they presented seven-point demand to the traditional ruler adding that if Igboho is not released, they would be forced to use magical powers to get him out of the custody. Aremu also demanded that the country be restructured or return to the 1960 Constitution. Angered by the increasing cases of killing for ritual money, Aremu sought for the establishment of a security Joint Task Force, comprising of soldiers, policemen, State Security Service and self-determination groups like Agbekoya, O.P.C, The Hunters, Vigilante and Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps to combat ritual killings, banditry and kidnaping in Yoruba land. He said: “We are channeling our demands and grievances to President Muhammadu Buhari, the Federal Government, South West Governors and politicians on the continuous detention of Sunday Igboho. “We demand unconditional release of Chief Sunday Adeyemo, who is currently under house arrest in Cotonou, Benin Republic. If they fail to release him, we will use our mystical powers to get him out of that prison. “We want the establishment of a security Joint Task Force, comprising of Soldiers, Police men, State Security Service and Self-determination groups like Agbekoya, O.P.C, the Hunters, Vigilante and Nigerian Civil Defence Corps to combat banditry, ritual killings, and kidnaping in Yoruba land.”
