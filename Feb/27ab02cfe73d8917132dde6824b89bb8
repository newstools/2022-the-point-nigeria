 The Kaduna State Government says that it recorded a total of 175 cholera-related deaths across the 23 local government areas of the state in year 2021. The Commissioner for Health in Kaduna State, Dr. Amina Muhammed-Baloni, made the disclosure when receiving cholera testing equipment donated by the World Health Organisation to the state in Kaduna, on Thursday. The materials were meant for the Zonal Cholera Laboratory at the late Yusuf Dantsofo Memorial Hospital in Tudun-Wada. Muhammed-Baloni told journalists that Kaduna State witnessed the number of deaths as almost all the 23 local government areas in the state were hit by cholera in the course of the year. According to her, the donation by the world health body would go a long way to enhance the containment of the disease in the state. Represented by the Permanent Secretary in the ministry, Adamu Mohammed-Mansir, Muhammed-Baloni said, “As far the issue of cholera was concerned in 2021, virtually all the local government areas had cases of cholera and casualties. “So, the effort by the World Health Organization concerning the health matters around the world, came at the right time because this will enhance our capability to not only do the rapid diagnostic test but also to know the type of cholera in the state. So, we thank WHO for its support to Kaduna State. “We recorded some deaths from the cholera epidemics. 175 people died from the disease in the state.”
