 BY BAMIDELE FAMOOFO OPEC Secretary General, HE Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo, was presented today with a special award in recognition and honouring of his achievements as Secretary General of the Organization. Barkindo received the award in a high-level gala dinner hosted by Egypt Petroleum Show (EGYPS) 2022, which is being held in Cairo between 14 and 16 February 2022. In his acceptance speech, the Secretary General praised the exemplary leadership and vision of HE Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, President of the Arab Republic of Egypt, and HE Tarek El-Molla, Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources, and congratulated them for successfully hosting the fifth edition of the event. “It has been the honour of a lifetime for me to serve as OPEC Secretary General. I count myself lucky to have been a witness to many historic moments and events in the last six years. The experience has confirmed for me, more than ever before, that nothing can be accomplished without teamwork,” Barkindo stated. “OPEC has helped the oil industry navigate some choppy waters over the last six years and taken action that ensured the survival of this industry. This has truly been a collective endeavour; the combined work of our Member Countries, their ministers and ministries of oil or energy, their capable staff and teams,” Barkindo stated. Barkindo will complete his second successful term as OPEC Secretary General in August 2022.
