 BY AGNES NWORIE, ABAKALIKI Former Secretary to Government of the Federation, Senator Anyim Pius Anyim, has lauded President Muhammadu Buhari for signing the Electoral Act Amendment Bill into law. In a statement by his Media Office, signed by Sam Nwaobasi on Friday, Anyim, a People’s Democratic Party Presidential aspirant, said that President Buhari “acted as a patriotic national leader by signing the Bill.” “It takes a man (that is) committed to the good of Nigeria to sign the Bill despite his objection to some provisions of the Bill. “Without the Electoral Act in place, the conduct of the 2023 general elections would be in jeopardy. “Already, the country and the Independent National Electoral Commission were on the edge over the delay in signing the Bill before Friday. “With the Electoral Act in place, a significant step towards the conduct of credible elections next year has been taken as the INEC, the political parties, aspirants and other critical stakeholders now have a legal document to guide them. “The Bill would also improve and engender clarity, effectiveness and transparency of the election process as well as reduce to the barest incidences of acrimony arising from dissatisfied candidates and political parties. “These commendable efforts are in line with the policy to bequeath posterity and landmark legal framework that paves the way for credible and sound electoral process that we would all be proud of.”
