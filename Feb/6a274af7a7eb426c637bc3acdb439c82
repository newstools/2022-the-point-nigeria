 BY AKINWALE ABOLUWADE The Chief Judge of Oyo State, Justice Munta Abimbola, on Thursday, ruled that elevated Baales and Mogajis in Ibadanland should stop wearing crowns and coronets, and return to their original statuses. Abimbola issued an order of perpetual injunction, restraining them from the status of elevation or wearing crowns or coronets in his judgement in a case instituted by 34 coronet-wearing Baales and Mogajis who were elevated alongside some High Chiefs by the late Governor Abiola Ajimobi in 2017 to contest the validity of the consent judgment entered by parties on Thursday, The CJ, in his judgement, said he found no merit in their application before the court, dismissed it in its entirety and answered all their questions in the negative. He further held that all government’s action must be in compliance with the law of the land. The claimants in the suit filed against the state governor and four others, earlier argued that the consent judgement, which nullified the review that elevated them, was not valid as they were not part of those who made the agreements that formed the consent judgment.
