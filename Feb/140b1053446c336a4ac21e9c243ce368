Others who were docked are Oluronbi Nurudeen, aged 41; Adeleke Mojeed, 38; and 20-year-old Aseru Samad. The four accused persons, with others now at large, were said to have been caught with one pump action gun with breech number 476 and one single barrel gun on January 13, at about 3pm at Number 4, Akede Street, Oke-Baale area, Osogbo.
