Heightened intrigues over zoning  BY BENEDICT NWACHUKWU, ABUJA All is set, or so it seems, for the February 26, 2022 National Convention of the All Progressives Congress. The ruling party, led by Mai Mala Buni as the Chairman, Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, foreclosed all doubts when it officially wrote to inform the Independent National Electoral Commission, as part of the legal requirements, of its readiness to conduct its National Convention. To be sure, the APC stands a very bright chance of electing a high-caliber national chairman from the catalogue of seasoned politicians jostling to superintend the affairs of the ruling party leading into the 2023 general elections. However, political pundits posit that for the APC to habour the dream of remaining in power beyond May 29, 2023, the party has no choice but to open its eyes wide and critically look into the records and antecedents of the 14 top political contenders who have littered the city of Abuja with their posters seeking to occupy the plum position of the party’s chairmanship. The talk in town from investigations by The Point is to the effect that most of the aspirants are puppets in the hands of powerful and influential power brokers who have pushed them forward with predetermined objectives in mind. Most of the aspirants are former this and former that, ranging from former governors to former senators to former party executives.
