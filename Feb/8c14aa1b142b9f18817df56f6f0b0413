 Former Minister of Water Resources, Sarah Ochekpe, alongside two other persons were, on Tuesday, jailed for N450 million fraud. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission charged the trio in 2018 with conspiracy and money laundering. However, Ochekpe, Raymond Dabo and Leo Jitung had entered a plea of no case submission. The Federal High Court in Jos  sentenced Dabo and Jitung to three months imprisonment each. Justice Musa Kurna gave the convicts an option of N1million fine each. The judge held that they withdrew N415million from a bank and delivered same to a governorship candidate. Kurna, however, said that they were guilty of withdrawing the N450 million which, allegedly, was above the threshold of an individual withdrawal. He said that the offence contravened the provisions of Section 16(1) of the Money Laundering Prohibition Act 2013 as amended. The offence carries a minimum of three-year-imprisonment or a N10million fine. The judge, in his discretion, sentenced them to three
-month-imprisonment each with an option of N1million fine each. (NAN).
