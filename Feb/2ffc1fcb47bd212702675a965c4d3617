 Musiliu Akinsanya, a.k.a MC Oluomo, the Lagos State Chairman of the National Union of Road Transport Workers, has the right to ascend the throne as Oba of Oshodi, the Almaroof-Kupoluyi family has insisted. Against the claim by the members of the Oshodi-Tapa Chieftaincy Family that Akinsanya had no right to ascend the throne, the Secretary of the Almaroof-Kupoluyi Family, Abdulwasiu Almaroof-Kupoluyi, on Tuesday, said that the family had the right to contest the stool. “Almaroof-Kupoluyi Family is part of the major ruling houses in Oshodi according to past judgements and steps taken to make Oshodi move on progressively. “The first kingmaker of Oshodi, who was from the Arota-Ologun Family in Oshodi, Pa Salaudeen Almaroof-Ewa, was my grandfather. “Almaroof-Kupoluyi Family is part of the Arota-Ologun Family that is one of the ruling houses legitimate to become king in Oshodi. How Musiliu Akinsanya, a.k.a MC Oluomo is related to our family is that under Pa Salaudeen Almaroof, we have 13 branches. “Out of the 13 branches, under the Almaroof Family, Akinsanya is related to Alhaja Shadia Almaroof, who was a younger sister. Our grandpa, Pa Salaudeen Almaroof, and Alhaja Shadia Almaroof, gave birth to MC Oluomo’s father,” Abdulwasiu said. He added that all royal families were entitled to nominate a candidate each to contest the throne. In its own right, the Alamroof-Kupoluyi had decided to present the NURTW leader as a candidate, he said.
