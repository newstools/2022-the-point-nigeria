 BY MAYOWA SAMUEL The House of Representatives has mandated its committee on Basic Education and Services to investigate incessant leakages of the West African Senior School Certificate Examination questions. Issuing this directive on Wednesday, it also asked the committee to investigate the repeated cancellations of examinations by WAEC in Nigeria. The lower chamber urged WAEC to establish more rigorous standards for the administration, monitoring, supervision and evaluation of O’ Level examinations in Nigeria. This followed the adoption of a motion at plenary by Benjamin Okezie Kalu who recalled that the examination body had, at several times in the past, cancelled examinations for similar reasons, citing the cancellation of Literature in English papers taken by private candidates in 2021. Okezie expressed concerns that the cancellation and subsequent rescheduling of examinations by WAEC resulted in wastage and incurred avoidable expenses.
