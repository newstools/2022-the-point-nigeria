I’m going blind, IPOB leader tells court  The case of Biafra political activist, Nnamdi Kanu, has been adjourned by Justice Binta Nyako of the Federal High Court, Abuja till April 8, 2022 for ruling. The trial of separatist leader resumed on Wednesday where Kanu is charged with 15 crimes, including terrorism, treason, incitement and operating an unlawful group. Kanu, who heads the outlawed separatist group, the Indigenous People of Biafra, had previously pleaded not guilty to the charges. Kanu’s lead counsel, Mike Ozekhome, SAN argued on Wednesday that his client was extraordinarily renditioned. He said offences allegedly committed by Kanu have no basis, adding that where and when they were committed were not stated in the charges. Kanu is asking the court to dismiss the charges against him on the ground that the alleged offences were not committed in Nigeria. He also claimed that no prima facie has been made against him by the Federal Government throughout the proof of evidence in support of the charges. Meanwhile, Kanu on Wednesday complained bitterly that he was going blind and pleaded with the judge to rescue him. Kanu said since his re-arrest, he had not been allowed to take reading glasses provided by his family. The defendant, who spoke through Ozekhome, informed Justice Nyako that his glasses that were brought to Kenya where he was arrested were damaged while being picked up. He further claimed that the glasses he brought to Nigeria in 2015 when he was first arrested were seized by the Department of State Services and have not been released to him. Kanu also complained that he had not been allowed to take clothes from his family, hence, he has been wearing the same cloth since his re-arrest in June last year.
