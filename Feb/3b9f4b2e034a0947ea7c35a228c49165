 A Federal High Court sitting in Ibadan, Oyo State, on Monday, sentenced a man named Ibrahim Idowu to 18 months imprisonment for trafficking 4kg of cannabis. R.O. Ige, NDLEA counsel, said that the convict was arraigned on a-count-charge bordering on unlawful possession of Indian Hemp. Ige explained that Idowu was caught on September 5 along the Ogbomosho-Ilorin Expressway. She stated that the offence contravened the provisions of Section 11(C) of the NDLEA Act  Cap, Number 30 Law of the Federation 2004. Counsel to the convict, Musibau Olapade, prayed the court for leniency on his client by reducing his jail term, citing the fact that he (Olapade) was a first time offender. Justice Uche Agomoh said that the sentence was based on the evidence against Idowu who pleaded guilty to the charges. Agomoh stated that in consideration of the provisions of Section 270 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act 2015 which stipulated that anyone who pleads guilty to an offence must be given a reduced sentence, “I considered the fact that Idowu has shown that he is remorseful and willing to turn a new leaf. “Furthermore, Idowu has not wasted the time and resources of this court before pleading guilty. However, to serve as deterrent to others, Idowu is sentenced to one and half years in prison. “The (weed) substance found in his possession shall be destroyed by the Nation Drug Law Enforcement Agency.” (NAN).
