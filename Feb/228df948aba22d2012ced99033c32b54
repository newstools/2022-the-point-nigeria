 The two-day meeting of the National Executive Committee of the Academic Staff Union of Universities has ended at the University of Lagos, Akoka, with a final decision by the union to proceed on an indefinite strike from Monday, February 14, 2022. ASUU President, Emmanuel Osodeke, said on Sunday that the strike was against the wish of the union, but added that they had to put the interest of the union first. According to him, “I announce to you with a heavy heart the commencement of a nationwide strike starting from 14th February till our needs are met.” The union had expressed grievances over the failure of the Federal Government to fulfill some of the agreements it made as far back as 2009. ASUU had on November 15, 2021 given the Federal Government a three-week ultimatum over the failure to meet their demands. The lecturers had threatened to embark on another round of industrial action following the alleged “government’s unfaithfulness” in the implementation of the Memorandum of Action it signed with the union, leading to the suspension of the 2020 strike action. After the union’s National Executive Council meeting at the University of Abuja on November 13 and 14, 2021, Osodeke had lamented that despite meeting with the Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige, on October 14, 2021, on issues, including funding for revitalisation of public universities, earned academic allowances, University Transparency Accountability Solution, promotion arrears, renegotiation of 2009 ASUU-FGN agreement, and the inconsistencies in Integrated Payroll and Personnel information system payment, none of its demands had been met.
