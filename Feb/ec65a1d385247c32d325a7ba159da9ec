 There was confusion in Guinea Bissau as suspected coup plotters killed some citizens and injured several others. President Umaro Sissoco Embalo confirmed, on Tuesday, that many people were seriously injured with several others injured in a failed coup. He stated that “The attackers could have spoken to me before these bloody events that have seriously injured many and claimed lives.” However, he failed to disclose the identity of those behind the unrest. Embalo said that the failed putsch was linked to his decisions “to fight drug trafficking and corruption.” AFP.
