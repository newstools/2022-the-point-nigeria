 Reports of preliminary investigations have shown that Hadiza Ibrahim, an Abuja beggar who was recently caught with N500, 000 and $100 has no links with drug peddlers, arms dealers, kidnap gangs, or any other criminal syndicate. Officials of the Social Development Secretariat, Federal Capital Territory Administration, gave the indication, saying that the money that was found on her was the total sum of her N2,000 daily contribution. Hadiza was arrested few days ago at a junction along the Ademola Adetokunbo Crescent, Wuse 2 District of Abuja. Her profile showed that she had been arrested on several occasions in the past 10 years by officials of the FCT for street begging. The acting Director, Social Welfare Services, SDS, Malam Sani Amar, said that it was clearly established that she was not into any nefarious act. Amar said, “Within our little knowledge and experience in discharging our duty, with the assistance of security personnel attached to us, we understand that Hadiza was not into any criminal activity and if you look at the money found in her possession, it was accumulated overtime. “On the profiling we did on her, we gave the Police in our team time to play their role and they did what they could and it was clearly established that she was not into such nefarious acts. “She was so wise to have selected the areas of her own begging business where she realises huge money daily.”
