However, while putting God first, you will be required to put in necessary efforts and knowing fully that it is hardwork that separates a genius from an ordinary student. “Furthermore, an indomitable spirit is needed to overcome discouragement, stress and peer pressure. I urge you to be good ambassadors of Christ throughout your stay and remember that as a university, we place high premium on the spiritual growth of our students. “In Redeemer’s University, we pride ourselves not only in the academic training of our students, but also in character, so that upon graduation, students are fully ready to be responsible citizens who will contribute to national development with absolute fear of God. “We encourage you to emulate the good examples of your predecessors in self-discipline, good mode of dressing commitment to their studies and good comportment, so that you will not be found wanting at any time.”
