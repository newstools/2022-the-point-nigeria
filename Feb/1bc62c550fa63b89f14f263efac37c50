TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO The State Commandant, Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps Commandant Emmanuel Ocheja has condemned the spate of child abuse in the state and threatened to wage severe war against the offensive act. Speaking through the Head of Unit, Anti-Human Trafficking, Irregular Migration and Gender Based Unit of the corps, Chief Superintendent of Corps, Clement Onifade
warned residents of the state to desist from molesting and maltreating children. Recall that the command had recently paraded a woman for allegedly pouring hot water on a child and beat her with sharp objects for misdemeanour. Onifade, during the corps’ television programme, ‘The Defender’ on Osun State Broadcasting Corporation (OSBC), on Thursday, declared the readiness of the command to combat criminal acts against children. He said, “Child Right Acts has been domesticated in Osun State and we will use it against anyone found guilty of abuse and ill-treatment of any child.” Onifade urged parents to desist from subjecting children to child labour, abuse and other forms of molestations, as the corps has the backings of both the Federal and the State Government laws to fight against child abuse. He praised the existing synergy amongst sister agencies and other relevant agencies for efficient results in ensuring brighter and secured future for all the children in the country. The command’s Public Relations Officer, Assistant Superintendent of Corps II, Atanda Olabisi, urged members of the public to report any case of child abuse to the command for prompt response. Atanda assured the public of the confidentiality of any information they volunteer to the command adding that the corps would continue to ensure security of lives, property and investments of citizens.
