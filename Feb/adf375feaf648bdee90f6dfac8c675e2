 BY AZARE, BAUCHI A commercial passenger bus rammed into a vehicle laden with petrol in Ilorin, Kwara State on Sunday causing the death of a pregnant woman and eight persons. The victims were reportedly burnt to death while eight others survived the crash with multiple burnt in the crash that occurred along the Ilorin International Airport Road, Ilorin-Ogbomoso Expressway at about 8am. It was learnt that the drivers of the vehicle laden with PMS with number plate, LRN 787 FE, and the Toyota Hiace commercial bus, had no driving license. An eyewitness was quoted as saying that 20 people (eight males and 12 females), were involved in the crash. A Federal Road Safety Corps official who craved anonymity, said that the Lagos-bound passenger bus had loaded at the Gerin Alimi Motor Park. A private vehicle said to be moving out of the airport reportedly failed to wait for the oncoming passenger bus leading to the accident. It was gathered that the vehicles involved somersaulted and had tyre burst before bursting into flame. The Sector Commander of the FRSC in the state, Jonathan Owoade, who confirmed the development, described the crash as unfortunate. Owoade said, “A car coming out of the airport ran across the road, thinking it could have crossed the road before the bus gets to it. Incidentally, it was carrying some kegs of fuel. I would surely get back to you with details, including registration numbers of the vehicles.” The sector commander added that the injured persons had been taken to the state general hospital, Ilorin before his men arrived at the scene of the crash, while the bodies of the deceased were taken to the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital Mortuary at Oke Oyi by the FRSC rescue and patrol teams.
