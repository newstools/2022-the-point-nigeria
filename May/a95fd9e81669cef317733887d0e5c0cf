…Cites discouraging happenings in the party  BY BENEDICT NWACHUKWU, ABUJA Frontline presidential aspirant in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and former Governor of Anambra State, Peter Obi, has resigned from the party. He has also withdrawn from the presidential race. Obi, in his resignation letter dated 24 May 2022 and addressed to the National Chairman, Iyorchia Ayu, blamed his resignation on recent developments within the party that have made it practically impossible for him to continue participating and making constructive contributions. The letter which was received on Wednesday, 25 May by the office of the National Chairman of the party reads, “I am writing to intimate you of my resignation from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) which was conveyed to the Chairman of Agulu Ward 2, Aniocha LGA, Anambra, effective Friday 20 May, 2022.
Consequently, I am by this letter informing you of my withdrawal of the PDP Presidential primaries. “It has been a great honour to contribute to nation-building efforts through our party. Unfortunately, recent developments within our party make it practically impossible to continue participating and making such constructive contributions. “Our national challenges are deep-seated and require that we each make profound sacrifices towards resuming our country. My commitment towards rescuing Nigeria remains firm, even if the route differs. “I wish to thank you personally for your graciousness and leadership. I wish you well and best of luck in the service of the country.” Few days ago, the pictures of Obi at the 10 Downing Street, London where he allegedly had closed door meeting with the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson went virile on social media.
It was also reported that a Coalition of over 17 groups has been mounting pressure on his to dump the party and seek an alternative platform to actualise his dream to rescue the nation.
