 BY MAYOWA SAMUEL The Nigerian Army in a statement on Tuesday, expressed disgust over the beheading and murder of two soldiers in Imo State by members of the Indigenous People of Biafra. The Army spokesman, Brigadier-General Onyema Nwachukwu in the statement stated that it received the tragic news of the gruesome, barbaric and despicable manner in which Master Warrant Officer (MWO) Audu M Linus (retired) and Private(Pte) Gloria Matthew were murdered on Saturday, 30 April, 2022. It accused IPOB and its armed affiliate, Eastern Security Network of the cold blooded murder of both soldiers who were heading to Imo State for their traditional wedding. “Apparently, the soldiers had embarked on the trip to fulfill the traditional rites of conjugating their matrimony, as the very well respected and cherished Igbo tradition demands. “Ironically, the fact that one of the soldiers, Pte Gloria Matthew, who hails from Nkwerre LGA of Imo State, has an ethnic affiliation with the good people of South East Nigeria did not prevail on the sensibility of the dissidents. “This dastardly act, one too many, clearly portends the deep seated hate, desperation and lawlessness with which foot soldiers of IPOB/ESN have being unleashing terror on Ndigbo, whom they claim they are on a mission to protect and emancipate, as well as other innocent Nigerians who are resident or transiting the South East,” he stated. The Army also in the statement, described the gruesome murder, in which they did not spare even one of their own, as callous, impenitent, indisputable, and a brazen act of terrorism perpetrated by IPOB/ESN, while promising to bring the perpetrators to book as investigation had already commenced. “Though the dissident groups have continued to live in denial, while masquerading as unknown gunmen in their criminal violent campaign in the region, the NA will ensure the perpetrators of this dastardly act unleashed on its personnel do not go unpunished. Sharing its deep condolences with the families, relations and close associates of the pair, the Army disclosed that it had commenced investigation to apprehend the criminals, as it enjoined members of the public to give security agencies information that will lead to the arrest of the criminals.
