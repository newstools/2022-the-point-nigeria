 The National Union of Road Transport Workers has ordered the members of the Lagos State Parks Management Committee, headed by Musiliu Akinsanya, otherwise called MC Oluomo, to vacate Ladoje, Agege, Lagos State Secretariat of the union. The Lagos State Chairman, NURTW Caretaker Committee, Fatai Adesina, a.k.a Akeweje, gave the instruction while briefing journalists at the weekend. MC Oluomo, former Chairman of NURTW in Lagos State, publicly renounced his membership of the union last month after being suspended over allegation of insubordination, among others following which Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu appointed him as Chairman of the newly created Lagos State Parks Management Committee. Adesina urged Governor Sanwo-Olu to prevail on MC Oluomo and his colleagues to stop using the NURTW secretariat as they are no longer members of the union. He said that “lt’s very improper and negates common sense. You renounced your membership of the union but you still hold tight to the property of the union. “We are appealing to the state government to help talk to the members of the committee to vacate our office. “That complex belongs to the NURTW and since you said you are no longer a member, courtesy demands that you drop all the union’s property in your possession. “We are all card-carrying members of the All progressives Congress and this is election period; we don’t want anything that will affect the peace in the state, hence, our appeal to Oluomo and his people to leave our property. “One of the terms of reference given to us is to collect all the union’s property, including cash from executives of former administration.”
