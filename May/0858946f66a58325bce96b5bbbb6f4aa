 The Department of State Service has begun the vetting of political aspirants at all levels in the country in a bid to fish out corrupt and criminal elements. As electioneering to usher in new set of leaders next year begins, the profiling and vetting of aspirants by DSS officials is targeted at sieving bad eggs. A DSS official (preferred anonymity) was quoted to have said that “The vetting is a continuous exercise and a core function of our mandate to determine if anyone who is seeking to occupy any office is fit and proper to do so in order to prevent criminally-minded elements from being saddle with sensitive government apparatus and institutions.” The security agency is expected to beam its searchlight on those with criminal records such as economic sabotage or corruption, terrorism financing and separatist agitation among others. The vetting was said to have been prompted by the inconsistencies in the information provided by politicians, thereby requiring cross-checking. An official was quoted to have said that “What we are doing is an examination of existing records already before us to determine what has changed and what has not and to be able to determine the extent of the inconsistency in each profile with a view to advising those involved accordingly in the interest of the country.” The DSS profiling is core for appointments and political decisions. The Public Relations Officer of the DSS, Dr. Peter Afunanya, said that vetting or profiling of political aspirant is a routine function of the agency and neither a probe nor for ulterior motive, but “The vetting is in the interest of all.”
