 Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, a presidential aspirant of the All Progressives Congress, has expressed confidence that the party would remain united after its presidential primaries. The National Leader of the party
spoke at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, on Tuesday after meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari. Tinubu, former governor of Lagos State, said that the increasing number of people seeking the party’s presidential ticket was good for democracy. He said that President Buhari had shown that he supported a transparent democratic process. “We are sure that we will remain united. You know our symbol is the broom; you don’t break it as you go. Nigeria requires commitment, a uniform system and a stable country. That is the only way we can be very proud of Nigeria. “The President has shown a great example of leadership, gave us the freedom to say you want to run, you want to attempt, go ahead. He is a democrat and if we are running a constitutional democracy, you don’t hinder the desire, the wish of other people,” Tinubu said. He stated that the increasing number of aspirants on the platform of the APC was in the best interest of the country. “The more the merrier. The more they come, the more challenging it becomes for you to think deeply, focus on issues and be ready to serve. It’s all about service, it’s nothing else. Think wisely, get committed to your thinking to serve the nation and bring progress and prosperity to the lives of Nigerians. “It’s good for the country for so many of us to aspire to want to lead. We’re not abandoning our nation. But, there’s only one chair and one possibility. We will do that,” he said.
