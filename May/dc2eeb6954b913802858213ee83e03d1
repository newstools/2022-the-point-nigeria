The party disclosed this on Monday night in Abuja in a statement issued by its National Secretary, Samuel Anyanwu.

The party, in a separate statement issued by its National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba, in Abuja on Monday night, said that the adjustment in date was occasioned by the Eid-Fitir celebration. “The NWC apologises for any inconveniences this change in date might have caused,” Ologunagba said.
