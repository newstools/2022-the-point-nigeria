 BY AGNES NWORIE, ABAKALIKI The leadership of People’s Democratic Party in Ebonyi State has debunked rumours of cancellation of the party’s primary elections in the state by the National Working Committee. In a statement by the Publicity Secretary, Chika Nwoba, the party described the rumours as personal opinion of the National Secretary of the party and never that of National Working Committee, as such should be disregarded. “Do kindly disregard the notice of cancellation of the Ebonyi PDP primary elections coming from the national publicity secretary. At no point did the National Working Committee sit to take such a decision. It’s a personal decision of the national secretary transmitted to the publicity secretary for publication. It’s only court can annul the outcome of the primaries and not a mere imagination of the secretary of the party. The national working committee is unaware of the annulment of the election. Therefore, party members and aspirants are urged to disregard the statement of cancellation.” Meanwhile, at the time of this report, the party had conducted primaries for only House of Representatives at the various zones while the party executives, stakeholders, delegates, aspirants, media representatives, among others wait at the party secretariat for the commencement of the gubernatorial primaries election amidst heavy security presence. The PDP primary election panel from Abuja had arrived at the party’s secretariat to conduct State House of Assembly, Senate, House of Representatives and gubernatorial primaries late last night and reported to the INEC office in Abakaliki for clearance and adoption.
