 Top independent rights experts, citing UN data, on Wednesday, said that seven journalists had been killed in Ukraine while many others faced unprecedented danger and even targeted in line of duty. The alert from UN-appointed independent rights experts, including the UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression, cited numerous reports that journalists were targeted. According to the report, journalists have been tortured, kidnapped, attacked and killed or refused safe passage from cities and regions under siege. Latest UN data indicates that seven journalists had been confirmed killed in Ukraine since the Russian invasion on February 24; the last time so many media professionals lost their lives in Ukraine was in 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea. The rights experts, in a statement, said that Russia’s war against Ukraine had been made easier by the “silencing of critical voices…over a prolonged period of time.’’ They pointed to the blocking of social media platforms and news websites in Russia, and the disruption of foreign media services. Experts stated that Moscow’s ‘massive labelling’ of independent media as ‘foreign agents’ is a source of concern. “We deplore the systematic crackdown on political opponents, independent journalists and the media, human rights activists, protesters and many others opposing the Russian government’s actions. “All these measures amount to the creation of a state monopoly on information in blatant violation of Russia’s international obligations.” Experts work on voluntary basis as Independent Experts or Special Rapporteurs; they are not UN staff and do not receive a salary for their work.
