 BY MAYOWA SAMUEL The Urhobo Traditional Rulers Council, on Sunday, directed Urhobo governorship aspirants vying to take over from Ifeanyi Okowa in 2023 to immediately meet among themselves and prune down their numbers as the various political parties head for their primaries. The Council said it had directed the aspirants to meet along their political parties and select the best hands to fly the flag of their various parties in the 2023 governorship election. The body insisted that it was the turn of Delta Central to produce the next governor of Delta State in the forthcoming governorship election. The Council also denounced endorsing any of the governorship aspirants angling to be the next chief executive of the state. Their position was made known after meeting with the aspirants of Urhobo extraction from the various political parties at the palace of Ohworode of Olomu Kingdom, Ughelli South, on Sunday.
Addressing journalists on behalf of the Council after the meeting, the Ovie of Idjerhe Kingdom, King Obukohwo Monday Whiskey, Udurhie 1, said the essence of the directive was to enable Urhobo aspirants emerge governorship candidates of the various political parties. Udurhie 1 said the Council, which comprised all Urhobo traditional rulers, would not endorse any candidate as all the aspirants were their sons and daughters and it was their duty to pray for their success. He noted that it was their duty as royal fathers, in line with the directive to reduce their numbers ahead of their primaries, to counsel them to ensure that the next governor of Delta State hails from Urhobo Nation.
