 A woman named Ebere Okonkwo has raised the alarm over the alleged disappearance of Dubuem, her husband, from Police custody in Anambra State. Dubuem, 48, a member of the Tricycle Owners Association of Nigeria, Awka branch, was said to have been arrested at Unizik junction park on March 15 over an undisclosed offence. His wife alleged that the man was paraded by the Anambra State Police Command without disclosing his offence. The 27-year-old-woman said that she became apprehensive as she could no longer reach her husband after being paraded. The mother-of-one urged the Inspector General of Police, Alkali Baba; the Minister of Women Affairs and Social Development, Pauline Tallen; and other concerned stakeholders to prevail on the CP to produce her husband.
