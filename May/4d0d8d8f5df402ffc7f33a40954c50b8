 No fewer than 10 persons were feared dead in an explosion that rocked an illegal oil refinery located at Uzuaku, a community in Ukwa West Local Government Area of Abia State. Three of the 10 casualties reportedly died on the spot on Friday evening. Seven others were said to have died later in the hospital where they were receiving treatment. It will be recalled that two weeks ago, an explosion reportedly killed over 100 people in Ohaji Egbema, Imo State. It was gathered that the Shell pipeline servicing the Uzuaku/Owaza axis had no crude oil supply for some weeks leading to the stoppage of illegal oil bunkering activities in the area. However, it was learnt that when activities resumed along the pipeline, illegal refinery operators went back to business thereby resulting in the tragedy. The Police Public Relations Officer, Abia State Command, Geoffrey Ogbonna, however, said that he had yet to be briefed on the incident.
