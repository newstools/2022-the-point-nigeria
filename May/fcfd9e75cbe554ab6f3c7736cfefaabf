 Super Eagles coach, Jose Peseiro has stated that he liked the response of his players in the second half and credited their desire and character despite the 2-1 loss to Mexico. Nigeria conceded the first goal in the 12th with a goal by Santi Gimenez but went level in the second half through Cyriel Dessers debut goal before losing the match three minutes later through an Willam Troost Ekong own goal. Losing his first match as Super Eagles gaffer, the coach picked positives in the performance of his team. “In the first half, Mexico was much better than us. In the second half, I think we had more balance. We had better control of the ball. Our team cannot stay every time but we had much control of the ball. “In the second half it was much better. We lost and I think Mexico had more opportunities. It was a loss but I’m happy with the performance of my players. They showed character because after what Mexico did to us in the first half, we improved much in the second half.” The Super Eagles will next face Ecuador in another friendly game with more players expected to have arrived camp while the team is also expected to have had more training sessions.
