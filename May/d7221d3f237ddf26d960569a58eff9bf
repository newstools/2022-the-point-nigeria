 TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO The Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Sokoto, Most Rev Matthew Hassan Kukah on Thursday demanded the arrest of killers of Ms. Deborah Yakubu, a 200-level Home Economics student of Shehu Shegari College of Education, Wamako, Sokoto. Deborah, a female Christian student was stoned and burnt to death by her Muslim classmates for allegedly commiting blasphemy against Prophet Mohammed on campus. Some students, in an attempt to protect what they claim to be the honour of the Islamic religion, killed Deborah after she was accused of committing blasphemy on campus. Condemning the act in a statement he personally signed and issued, the Catholic bishop urged concerned authorities to investigate the murder and ensure that all the culprits were brought to book. According to Kukah, “I have received with deep shock the news of the tragedy that has occured in the Sheu Shegari College of Education, Sokoto, leading to the gruesome murder of Ms. Deborah Yakubu, a 200-level Home Economics Student today. “We condemn this incident in the strongest terms and call on the authorities to investigate this tragedy and ensure that all the culprits are brought to book. The only obligation that is owed her immediate family, her fellow students and the school authorities is the assurance that those who are guilty of this inhuman act, no matter their motivation, are punished according to the extant laws of our land. “This has nothing to do with Religion. Christians have lived peacefully with their Muslim neighbours here in Sokoto over the years. This matter must be treated as a criminal act and the law must take its cause. “Therefore, I wish to call on Christians in Sokoto and around to remain calm and to pray for the repose of the soul of Ms Deborah. It’s the first obligation we owe her. May God grant her eternal rest and console her immediate family.”
