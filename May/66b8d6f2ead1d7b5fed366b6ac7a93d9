 The Academic Staff Union of Universities has said that it would decide the next course of action after the expiration of its warning strike. The two months rollover strike by the academic union would end this week. Meanwhile, on Sunday, the union denied the report that it received a notice of meeting with the Federal Ministry of Labour and Employment. There were indications, last Friday, that the Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr Chris Ngige, during a meeting with the striking National Association of Academic Technologists promised to meet with ASUU this week. The acting spokesman of the Ministry, Patience Onuobia, quoted Ngige as saying that “As a conciliator, I manage you people in measured steps. That is why I want to take all of you holistically and I ask for your cooperation. When I finish with you today, I will continue with ASUU next week. “The Federal Government will resume talks with ASUU by next week as part of moves to end the lingering strike by the lecturers.” The President of ASUU, Prof. Emmanuel Osodeke, was reported to have said, however, that “No, we have not received any notice of meeting from them. They didn’t call us. We are not begging them to meet with us and we will not go to them if they do not invite us. It’s part of his political campaign, we didn’t receive any invite.” Osodeke said that the next line of action would be determined by members of the union. He berated some ministers for buying the nomination forms to contest for president in 2023.
