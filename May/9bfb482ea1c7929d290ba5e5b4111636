 Former national chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Adams Oshiomhole, has declared his intention to contest for president in 2023. Oshiomhole, who was the governor of Edo State, announced his intention to contest at the Cyprian Ekwensi House in Abuja, on Wednesday. He said that he would fix all sectors of the country if elected just as he would ensure a stable academic calendar for universities. Oshiomhole stressed, “I want to declare that I will do everything possible to engage not just ASUU, but all stakeholders to ensure the academic calendar is maintained.” He stated that he was not contesting to lament the imperfections in the country, but to set Nigeria on the path of greatness. According to him, going by the dictates of the country’s constitution, President Muhammadu Buhari will vacate the office on May 29, 2023, hence, his decision to replace him as the president of the country. Oshiomhole stressed that the economy of the country remained an issue, despite the effort of the present APC administration. He stated that “I want Nigeria to be described as the smartest country on the continent under my presidency.”
