 Some aggrieved students of the Federal University of Technology, Akure; Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba Akoko; and Olusegun Agagu University of Technology, Okitipupa, in Ondo State have mounted road blocks along the Ilesha/Akure Highway, Ondo State, in protest against the prolonged strike by the Academic Staff Union of Universities. The protesting students barricaded the highway to express their displeasure against the strike embarked upon by the lecturers. Vehicular movements were reportedly hampered as the protesters, flanked with placards with inscriptions such as ‘End ASUU strike’ and ‘Save our future,’ chanted anti-government songs.
