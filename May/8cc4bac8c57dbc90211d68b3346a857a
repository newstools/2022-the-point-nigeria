 The People’s Democratic Party secretariat along Finbars Road, Umuahia, Abia State, was on Thursday morning taken over by heavily armed police personnel. The security personnel, who were said to be acting on ‘an order from above,’ prevented staff and visitors from accessing the premises. However, the Publicity Secretary of the PDP in the state, Fabian Nwankwo, said that there was no cause for alarm. According to him, the party was observing one-day-of-rest, hence party officials as well as workers were asked to stay at home to rest. He stated that the party officials and staff needed to take a rest because of the accumulated stress arising from weeks of heavy activities. He indicated that activities would resume at the secretariat on Friday, insisting that the presence of security personnel at the premises was not strange. There were protests at the secretariat of the party on Tuesday and Wednesday following disagreements among members over the three-man delegates congress. The Dr Asiforo Okere-led state leadership of the party was accused by some aggrieved persons of compromise and plots to manipulate the congress in favour of a certain anointed governorship aspirant. Therefore, they demanded his immediate resignation or sack to enable the party have a fair leadership that would provide a level playground for all aspirants. During a protest, on Wednesday, a mammoth crowd besieged the party secretariat in solidarity with Okere-led leadership. The protesters, assuring him of their support, told him not to be intimidated by those attempting to hijack power. Meanwhile, the 47-member State Working Committee has described those who are against the chairman of the party as faceless individuals.
