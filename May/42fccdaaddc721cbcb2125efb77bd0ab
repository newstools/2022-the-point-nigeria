 Some yet-to-be-identified-gunmen have reportedly written letters to notify nine local government council areas in Anambra State of their plan to attack some communities. The gunmen listed the council areas marked for attack as Ihiala, Aguata, Nnewi South, Awka North, Awka South, Idemili North, Idemili South, Orumba South, Orumba North and Anambra East. They were alleged to have said that security operatives should prepare for action in Biafra land. The letter purportedly written by the gang read that “These local government areas should wait for us soon. “We are warning our dear Professor that it is time for action and not time to speak big grammar and talking. “All the security men occupying should get ready for action. “Go and tell the President to release our oga (boss), Onyendu, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, or face continuous war – FINAL WARNING.” The Police Public Relations Officer in the Command, Tochukwu Ikenga, on Tuesday, said that the security personnel in the state were maintaining law and order.
