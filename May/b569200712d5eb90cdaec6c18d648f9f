 BY MAYOWA SAMUEL Officials of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission have finally arrested former Imo State governor, Senator Rochas Okorocha on Tuesday. This was after the anti-graft agency laid siege to his Maitama residence in the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja from 11:30am  before forcefully breaking into his entrance door to gain access into the ground floor to arrest him. Security operatives who accompanied the EFCC officers had shot sporadically to disperse supporters who came to show solidarity for the embattled former governor. They also sent away journalists and staff of the senator. The Senator’s second son, Amen Okorocha, was reportedly wounded in the incident and was attended to. The anti-graft body had also barricaded the entrance gate with their vehicles while heavily armed policemen were stationed at all strategic locations inside and outside the premises. The Imo West senator had declined to give himself up for arrest without a warrant. In a statement on Tuesday, Wilson Uwujaren, EFCC’s spokesperson, said they were at the house in order to bring the former governor to stand trial before a Federal High court in Abuja.
