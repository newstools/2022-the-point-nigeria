 Former governor of Lagos State, Bola Tinubu, has begged delegates from Gombe State to support his aspiration to become president. Tinubu spoke on Tuesday during a meeting with delegates, lamenting the current challenges of the country. He said, “Today is the day I have come to ask for your support to be president of Nigeria. You can put me there with your voters. “I believe in myself, I’m confident, capable, intelligent, courageous, brave, determined, and the government is not a joke. “In the coming delegate election, choose wisely, choose me, I beg you ooo.” The All Progressives Congress chief said that he would tackle insecurity head on, stressing that his government would develop contemporary measures in ridding the country of criminality. He stated that the delegates had the power to consolidate his quest to the number one position of Nigeria, adding that he had the capacity to reposition the country. He added that “We have an opportunity to change Nigeria, I guarantee we will change Nigeria. The change in Lagos is just beginning, the change that made Lagos the richest state in Africa now. We will collaborate with all the states of the federation.” The Chief of Staff to Gombe State governor, Inuwa Kari, said it was pay back time, adding that Tinubu worked assiduously for the growth of the APC. Kari, who doubles as state coordinator of Asiwaju Movement 2023 in Gombe, added that people should rally round the national leader towards realising his aspiration. He said, “We know what we did to put the party together. Through this great man, we are at the Villa, and we are in charge of the government in Gombe.”
