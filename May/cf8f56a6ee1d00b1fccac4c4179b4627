The National Association of Nigerian Students has advised the Academy Staff Union of Universities not to be rigid in their negotiating with the Federal Government. Senator Chris Ngige, Minister of Labour and Employment, indicated in a statement on Friday that talks would resume between FG and ASUU in a bid to end the prolonged strike. The Chairman of NANS in Osun State, Oyelayo Oyewole, at the NUJ Press Center, Osogbo, said that the  ongoing strike by ASUU showed that education is less important to the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari. He blamed the Minister of State for Education, Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba, for purchasing N100 million APC presidential form as the strike by universities’ lecturers was ongoing. Oyewole said, “We charge the ASUU leadership to employ and adopt flexibility during the cause of negotiation as excessive rigidity may cause the process to reach yet another dead-end. “We call on all students’ association and their leaders to shun polarization of genuine struggle and embrace the unity of genuine purpose in a bid to channel the necessary energy towards putting an end to the incessant ASUU strike.”
