 A former governor of Zamfara State, Abdul’aziz Yari, has been arrested by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission. It was gathered that the former governor was arrested for his alleged role in the N84 billion frauds involving a former Accountant General of the Federation, Ahmed Idris. The Point learnt that Yari was picked up at about 5pm on Sunday for allegedly benefitting to the tune of N22 billion from the N84 billion which the former AGF reportedly paid to another suspect. The EFCC also arrested one Anthony Yaro who is the Chairman and Managing Director of Finex Professional – the company through which former Governor Yari allegedly benefited from the fund. Yari’s arrest came barely a day after he won the ticket of the All Progressives Congress to contest for one of the three senatorial district seats of Zamfara State in the National Assembly.
