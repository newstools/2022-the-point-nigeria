An estranged lover, simply identified as Toba, has allegedly slit open the throat of Tunrayo Odubanjo, his girlfriend over a conflict that arose when he wore the man’s slippers on an errand. Report had it that Odubanjo, who was at Toba’s residence, decided to wear his slippers to buy him an alcoholic drink as he requested. One of their neighbours, who gave her name simply as Peju, alleged that when Odubanjo returned, the man accused her of wearing his slippers. Peju said, “He told her to pack out of his house but she kept begging him. When she decided to leave the house, she could not see her slippers. She asked him for the slippers and Toba said he threw them into the bush. “She pleaded with him to help her retrieve them from the bush, but he refused. “I tried to intervene, but he threatened to use broken tiles on me, so, I withdrew and continued with what I was doing. The girl later asked me for slippers, but I told her I had none. Suddenly, he pursued the girl again, dragged her into the bush and started beating her. “I heard the girl begging and thought it was just beating. After a few minutes, I suddenly saw him sitting on the lady. I quickly called people at the site and the son of a chief in our community and they rushed down to apprehend him as he abandoned her corpse in the bush and wanted to run. Toba used broken tiles to slit his girlfriend’s throat.” According to Qudus, a resident of the community, Toba, who just packed to the area, was taken to Mowe Police Station. Qudus alleged, “I saw the girl’s corpse as people carried her out of the bush. A cloth was used to cover her neck. He moved into his house in the community two days ago; he is popular for selling Indian hemp.” The Police Public Relations Officer, Ogun State Command, Abimbola Oyeyemi, said that the command would issue a statement on the incident later on Thursday. Oyeyemi was quoted as saying that “I can’t give a reaction now; I want to see the person myself to know what actually happened.”
