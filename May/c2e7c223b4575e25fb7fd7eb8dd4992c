Senator Ademola Adeleke has been confirmed as the authentic candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in the July 16 governorship election in Osun State. The declaration was made by Justice Nathaniel Emmanuel of the Federal High Court, Osogbo on Wednesday while ruling on a suit filed by a factional PDP governorship candidate in Osun State, Prince Dotun Babayemi. The judge held that court could not pick candidates for a political party, stating that the wrangling within the PDP was an internal issue. Two governorship primary elections were held by two different factions within the PDP on March 8. The Wale Ojo faction, which produced Dotun Babayemi, held their primary at the WOCDIF Centre, Osogbo, while the Adeleke faction had their primary at the Osogbo township stadium. The Independent National Electoral Commission, however, recognised the primary held by the Adeleke faction, under the supervision of the deputy governor of Bayelsa State, Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo. In the list of candidates published by INEC, Adeleke was recognised as the duly elected candidate of PDP. This prompted Babayemi to approach the court to challenge the recognition of Adeleke by the PDP and INEC.
