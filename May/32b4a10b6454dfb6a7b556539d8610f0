 The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission has arrested former speaker of the House of Representatives, Patricia Etteh. Etteh, who was grilled by EFCC’s special duties unit, was alleged to be involved in a solar power electrification scam in Akwa Ibom State. Etteh was elected Speaker in 2007 but resigned only after a few months amid allegations of financial misappropriation. She is the only woman in the country’s history to have been elected Speaker. On Monday, the EFCC had also arrested the Accountant-General of the Federation, Ahmed Idris over an N80 billion fraud.
