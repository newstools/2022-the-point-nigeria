 BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO Prince Dotun Babayemi, a factional candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in Osun State ahead of the July 16 governorship election has said the administration of the party when voted into power would change the current retrogressive narratives being experienced in the state for the better. To bring this assurance to fruition, Babayemi enjoined the people of the state and related stakeholders to rally round the party to ensure it emerges victorious at the poll. In a statement issued by the Director of Media, Omooba Dotun Babayemi Campaign Organization, Kayode Oladeji, the governorship hopeful opined that it was only the support of the people of the state that could lead to the realization of the dream of transforming and re-engineering the fiber of the state. According to Babayemi, change of power baton in the state had become imperative in view of the hardship civil servants and the generality of the people of the state have been going through. He said, “a PDP led administration in Osun after the July 16 gubernatorial election, shall surely return the state to a glorious past and further raise the bar for an all-round development. The present excruciating narratives which have pauperized our people, shall become a thing of the past. With this, every sector shall be pragmatically attended to, for the betterment of the state and its people.” Babayemi noted that with the increasing support base of the PDP, he was optimistic that the party would defeat other parties at coming election. He then called on members of the party and stakeholders across the state, to continue to mobilise for the success of the party at the coming polls. He further stressed that it was only when PDP members vigorously campaign and mobilise that it could jointly bring to bear its desires to navigate new and prosperous courses for our Osun state and its people.
