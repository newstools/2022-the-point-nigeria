 Some suspected hoodlums have reportedly kidnapped some travellers during an attack along the Abuja-Kaduna Highway. A traveller named Alhaji Ibrahim Musa alleged that he escaped being kidnapped by a stroke of luck in an operation that lasted more than an hour. Musa, who was on his way to visit a friend in Abuja, said that there were heavy gunshots as they approached Kurmin Kare, close to Katari. He stated that “I was going to Abuja to visit a friend who promised to give me a contract. Around Kurmin Kare, I started hearing gunshots, but didn’t know the direction. I then summoned courage to move, but this time, I was driving slowly to get the direction of the gunshots. “After a bend, close to Katari, I saw so many vehicles parked, I reversed until I escaped.” According to him, while he was returning to Kaduna, he saw a convoy of security personnel, but the bandits had left with the victims into the bush. Attempts to confirm the incident with the Police were abortive as the Police Public Relations Officer, Kaduna State Command, ASP Mohammed Jalige, did not pick up his calls as of the time of filing this report.
