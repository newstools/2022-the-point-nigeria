 The ruling All Progressives Congress has condemned the request by the Nigeria Drug Law Enforcement Agency that aspirants for elective offices should undergo a drug test. The National Publicity Secretary of APC, Felix Morka, stated that the matter had not been tabled for discussion by the National Working Committee. Brig. Gen. Buba Marwa (retd.), Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the NDLEA, wrote the APC National Chairman, Sen. Abdullahi Adamu, requesting that officials of the NDLEA should be given access to conduct drug integrity tests for politicians seeking elective offices in the country. Marwa said that the People’s Democratic Party and other political parties would also be contacted for drug integrity tests when they are about to conduct their party primaries. “Marwa is a respected member of this party but on this matter, we believe he has not been briefed appropriately. “If he was properly briefed, he would have known the set of laws guiding political party operations and understood that he cannot make such requests. “I can guess that the letter was dead on arrival. I don’t even expect the party hierarchy to start meeting on the issue,” a party official, who preferred anonymity, was quoted as saying.
