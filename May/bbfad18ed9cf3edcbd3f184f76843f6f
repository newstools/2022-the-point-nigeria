 The Campaign Organisation of Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, on Wednesday, declared that it would provide hotel accommodations for more than 7,000 All Progressives Congress (APC) delegates across the country in the party’s presidential primary election. Presidential aide, Senator Babafemi Ojudu, who has been the arrowhead of the Osinbajo campaign, announced this to delegates in Minna, Niger State while asking them to vote for Osinbajo during the party primary election. “Before you leave Minna to the national delegates conference, your hotel accommodations and other things will be provided for you to enable you feel at home throughout the delegates conference. “We have provided hotel accommodations for the more than 7,000 APC delegates to the presidential primary election. “We don’t want a situation where more than one person will stay in a room. “We want all of you to feel comfortable during the primary election,” he declared. Ojudu also assured the delegates that there would be vehicles to convey them to and from their hotels and also a desk officer in each hotel to attend to the needs of the delegates. “At the hotel, food will be provided and there will be a desk officer to attend to all your needs,” he said. Ojudu equally revealed that the campaign organisation would do everything possible to reward the delegates if Osinbajo is elected as the party’s flagbearer and should he emerge the president in 2023. “In the past, our delegates have not been rewarded, rather other people who did not contribute were rewarded with appointments and jobs. “If Osinbajo is elected as promised, we are going to reward all of you with jobs and appointments,” he said. While Ojudu was briefing the delegates and newsmen, Osinbajo was having a closed door meeting with Governor Abubakar Bello. After the meeting with Bello, Osinbajo also met the delegates before leaving Minna for Abuja.
