 The Lagos State Building Control Agency discloses that it has marked over 10 structures in the state for demolition. This, the agency said, was part of the efforts to rid the state of distressed buildings and associated danger of building collapse. The Head of Public Affairs, LASBCA, Adetayo Asagba, said in a statement that the buildings were marked for being structurally distressed and unsafe for human habitation. Recall that a distressed building located at 47 Jebba Street, Ebute-Metta, Lagos State was recently demolished. Other houses marked for demolition before the end of the week by LASBCA are located at 37 Coates Street; 3, Ondo Street; 14 Ondo Street; 16 Church Street; 13, Ibadan Street; 3 Simpson Street; 35 Jebba Stree; 11 Jeba Street; and 19 Ibadan Street. The General Manager, LASBCA, Gbolahan Oki, lauded the community leaders, youths, and residents of Jebba Street, Ebute-Metta for cooperating with the agency during the demolition of House 47. Oki, who described the exercise as a proactive step by the agency to prevent the loss of lives and property due to avoidable building collapses, said that the move became imperative. He said, “We urge the people to recognise the urgency in this matter as we cannot afford to wait for another building to collapse; because every distressed building is a disaster in waiting. “Occupants of distressed buildings will keep asking for more time before they vacate but the truth is that we cannot afford to wait in the matter of life and death.”
