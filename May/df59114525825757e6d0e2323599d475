 The Indigenous People of Biafra has denied the allegation that it issued a sit-at-home order against the visit of President Buhari to Ebonyi and Enugu states. Report had it that foremost nationalist and First Republic Aviation Minister, Chief Mbazulike Amechi, on Wednesday, appealed to IPOB to withdraw its alleged order for the people of the zone to sit at home in protest against Buhari’s visit. He was quoted as saying that President Buhari’s visit to Ebonyi State would afford stakeholders in the zone opportunity to discuss the release of IPOB leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, and other vital issues, including insecurity in Igbo land. Amechi said, “I’m appealing to IPOB or any group behind the alleged statement to please withdraw it, because it amounts to working against the release of our son, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. You cannot be working for the release of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu when you cannot allow us to discuss his release from detention.” Meanwhile, IPOB in a reaction by its Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful, said that IPOB did not issue any statement ordering a sit at home.
“The sit-at-home order is not from us; it is one of those lies the Police, Army, and DSS, use to tarnish our image. We have been saying that all the Nigerian Police, Nigerian Army, DSS, and other Nigerian security agencies know how to do best is to tell lies against us. We have been saying it and people are beginning to understand what we have been complaining about Nigerian security agencies and their lies and fabricated statements against IPOB. “We are not interested in what Dave Umahi, the Governor of Ebonyi State is doing with Buhari in his state. We know he is using their President to play his politics. We are aware that he wants to use the opportunity to declare his presidential ambition and therefore, we are not interested in what they are doing there. If we are interested, we know what to do.”
