 Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State has begun the move to stop Abdulmumin Jibrin, the Director General of Tinubu Support Group from defecting from the All Progressives Congress. The indication was given in a statement issued by the APC Chairman in Kano State, Abdullahi Abbas, on Sunday. Jibrin had on Saturday announced his exit from the ruling APC, saying that he would announce his new political party within 24 hours. The statement by Abbas, however, read that Ganduje directed the state secretariat of the APC to take urgent measures to resolve crisis within the party. It read, “To this end, the party secretariat has complied and summoned a stakeholders’ meeting to discuss the situation in the constituency. “An invitation has been sent to all the aspiring candidates for the position. “Abdulmumin Jibrin Kofa has already accepted the proposal and readiness to attend the meeting.” It urged all aggrieved members of the party to remain calm and align with the fold in its efforts to resolve ongoing crisis.
