 BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO There was a pandemonium at the Osogbo residence of the chairman, Osun State Chapter of the All Progressives Congress, Prince Gboyega Famodun as policemen dispersed some aggrieved members of the party who stormed the area to protest over alleged manipulation of election results for Ila/Ifedayo/Boluwaduro Federal Constituency. The aggrieved members of APC, it was gathered, stormed the residence of Famodun on Friday evening to protest against the alleged rigging of the primary election result. It was gathered that a House of Representatives aspirant, Ismail Kolawole, from the Ila federal constituency who led the protest was arrested by the police. But when our correspondent contacted the Police Public Relations Officer, Yemisi Opalola, she could not confirm the arrest. The protesters, who were dispersed by gunshot and teargas, accused the party of rigging the primary election in favour of immediate past Commissioner for Tourism and Culture, Adebisi Obawale, who was declared the winner after Kolawole had allegedly won the primary. The protesters threatened to leave the party if the party fail to address the matter and declare Kolawole winner of the primary election. When contacted, the Special Adviser to the Governor on Political Matter, Sunday Akere, said it was too early to protest, advising aggrieved members of the party to wait for the final announcement by the committee.
