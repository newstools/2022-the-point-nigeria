 BY AGNES NWORIE, ABAKALIKI Former Secretary to Ebonyi State Government, Bernard Odoh, has won the gubernatorial ticket to contest for the governorship seat in the state under the All Progressives Grand Alliance. Odoh was declared winner by chairman of APGA governorship electoral panel, Samson Olarere, having contested unopposed. Odoh, a former secretary to Ebonyi state government, made this known shortly after being declared winner at the just concluded governorship primary election of the party in the state. He revealed the preparedness of APGA in the state to defeat both APC and PDP in the forthcoming general election and called for regional political economy. Odoh polled 513 voted to emerge winner. The APGA governorship candidate stressed that the only way to make progress is to support regional political economy. According to him, “We are pleased that APGA found us worthy to fly its flag in the forthcoming 2023 general election as its candidates. We want to let Ebonyians know that, as today we are the only party that is not in crisis. “We are standing strong and we don’t have parallel primary election in Ebonyi State. The other two parties; the All Progressives Congress and People’s Democratic Party, are in their crisis and their crisis will never end. “We are pleading with our people never to waste their votes, give us the votes. This is the time to seek for the South East political economy. APGA has come to stay. We want to have a party that is able to create prosperity for our people. It is a party that has respect for human dignity. The only way to make real progress is to support regional political economy, and APGA is ready to give the chance,” he said.
