Oladiji promised to improve revenue generation for the university and the welfare of staff and students of the institution. She asked for the support of her co-applicants and the university community for her to succeed in the new task. She said, “The Federal University of Technology, Akure is doing well, but there is always room for improvement. “As a university of technology, we must be prepared to deal with emerging questions to be answered. The COVID-19 experience showed there is a lot of ground yet uncovered. “Addressing most of the big issues facing humanity captured succinctly in the sustainable development goals requires that we network across country borders and academic disciplines. “No single institution, country or discipline can exclusively provide solutions. “We will network and be the hub for the much-desired change in the higher education sector. “I will focus on improved Internally Generated Revenue (IGR), staff and student’s welfare, capacity building, research, infrastructural development, positive impacts on host communities, amongst others,” she stated.
