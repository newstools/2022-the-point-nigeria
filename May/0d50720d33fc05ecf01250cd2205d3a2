 The Federal Government has disclosed that the Abuja-Kaduna train service will resume on May 23. Yakubu Mahmood, Spokesman for the Nigerian Railway Corporation, said this in a statement, on Monday. In March, the Federal Government suspended operations on the route after an attack on the train by suspected terrorists. Eight passengers died with some injured in the attack, while many were kidnapped. Mahmood was quoted in the statement as saying that the decision to resume operations did not mean that efforts to secure the safe release of those abducted had been shelved. The statement read that “The government wishes to assure the relatives of the abducted citizens still in captivity that the safe rescue of these passengers is a top priority and not to misconstrue the resumption of train services, like abandonment or nonchalant attitude of the government towards their plight. “The Federal Government will never abdicate its responsibility in rescuing these valuable citizens, however, the government assures of its resolve not to succumb to threats by any faceless group.” Families of the abducted passengers had warned the Federal Government not to resume operations along the route until their loved ones were rescued.
