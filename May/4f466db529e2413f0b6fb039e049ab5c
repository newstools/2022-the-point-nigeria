 MAYOWA SAMUEL The United Kingdom has denied proscribing the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, and listing them among terrorist groups or organisations banned under UK law. This was contained in a statement by the British High Commission in Nigeria signed by its Senior Communications and Public Diplomacy Officer, Atinuke Akande-Alegbe on Friday. Stating that it was aware of the inaccurate reporting circulating in the media and online, the U.K. in the statement said, “These reports are untrue. The ‘Indigenous People of Biafra’ (IPOB) is not a proscribed organisation in the UK.” “The inaccurate reporting relates to the 13 April, 2022 publication by the UK Government of a revised Country Policy and Information note (CPIN) on separatist groups in SE Nigeria, including the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). CPINs provide country of origin information (COI) and analysis of COI for use by UK Government decision-makers handling particular types of protection and human rights claims. “All asylum and human rights claims made in the UK are considered on their individual facts in accordance with our obligations under the UN Refugee Convention and European Convention on Human Rights, taking into account relevant background country information and case law. “The CPIN on separatist groups in the South East, including the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), provides a general assessment of risks faced by individuals belonging to those groups. These assessments are based on an analysis of publicly available country information obtained from a wide range of reliable sources including media outlets; UK and other governments; local, national and international organisations; and non-government organisations. “This CPIN also acknowledges that the Nigerian government has proscribed IPOB as a terrorist organisation, some members of IPOB have reportedly used violence against the state and members of the public, and advises that persons who have committed human rights abuses must not be granted protection,” the UK government explained.
