 A political pressure group, Save Nigeria-Buhari Ambassadors, has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to adopt his predecessor, Goodluck Jonathan, as consensus candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress. According to the group, the call was made in view of Jonathan’s qualities as a seasoned democrat with the interest of the nation at heart. The national coordinator of the group, Jazeel Jamil Ibrahim, described the former President as a true leader who epitomised unification. He recalled that Jonathan shelved his personal ambition to avert crisis in 2015 by declaring that his ambition was not worth the blood of any Nigerian. Ibrahim’s address presented at a conference in Abuja on Wednesday, read, “We wish to call on Mr. President to look inward with his eagle’s eyes and single out Dr. Goodluck Jonathan from the hustling crowd of aspirants canvassing for the Office of the President of Nigeria as a candidate to fly the flag of the APC in 2023 Presidential election. “Dr. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan has established himself as a true democrat, a peace ambassador and a patriotic Nigerian who stand for the unification and cementing of the already fragmented pieces called Nigeria as one indivisible nation. “Jonathan has high level of integrity and credibility. He is a sound academician, an egg head with capacity to revamp and revive any economy. “He is a secured leader who tenaciously and systematically drives with passion his overwhelming commitment to change the global negative perceptions of the Nigerian elections by reforming the electoral process and establishing a culture of non-violent, free, fair and credible elections.”
