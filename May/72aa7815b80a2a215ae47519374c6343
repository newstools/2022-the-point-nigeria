 Rotimi Amaechi, Minister of Transportation, has stated his resolve to resign his appointment on Monday. This is following a directive by President Muhammadu Buhari that members of the Federal Executive Council seeking elective positions should quit from his administration. Amaechi gave the indication in Kaduna on Sunday while canvassing the support of the All Progressives Congress delegates for the presidential primary. The Minister, who expressed appreciation to Buhari for the opportunity given him to serve in his administration, stressed that the attack on the Abuja-Kaduna train would not have happened if the FEC approved the surveillance contract he request to monitor the rail track.
