 BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO Two elderly men have been dragged before a Magistrate’s Court sitting in Osogbo, Osun State for allegedly stealing the sum of N1 million from a resident of the town. The accused persons, Oladepo Rabiu, 70; and Olusoji Aliu, 60; were said to have fraudulently obtained the said amount of money from a man called Balogun Saheed Olugbenga with a pretense that they would sell a half plot of land to him. According to the police, the duo converted the money that was fraudulently collected from Olugbenga to their own use and failed to make available the piece of land to him. The charge brought against them read that “Oladepo Rabiu and Olusoji Aliu and others now at large, on September 19, 2021, at about 11am at Zone 9, Oke-Arungbo, Capital area, Osogbo did conspire to commit felony to wit obtaining money under false pretense/stealing. “You did fraudulently obtain the sum of N1million from one Balogun Saheed Olugbenga on the pretense of selling half a plot of land situated at Arungbo area, Osogbo known to you to be false. “You did steal and convert to your own use the sum of N1million property of one Balogun Saheed Olugbenga.” Police prosecutor, Inspector Rasheed Anifowoshe, said that the duo committed offences contrary to sections 418 and 383 and punishable under sections 516, 419 and 390(9) of the Criminal Code, Cap 34, Volume II, Laws of Osun State, 2003. They, however, pleaded not guilty to the accusations. Their lawyer, Tunbosun Oladipupo, urged the court to grant them bail. The counsel assured the court that as old citizens, they would not abuse the bail privilege. Magistrate A. Adebayo granted them bail in the sum of N1million with one surety each in the same amount and adjourned the matter till May 19 for mention.
