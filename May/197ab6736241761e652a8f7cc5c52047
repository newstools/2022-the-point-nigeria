 The Joint Admission and Matriculation Board has resulted to postponing its ongoing examinations in Onitsha and other parts of Anambra State from yesterday, (Monday) to tomorrow (Wednesday). Checks showed that the examinations were postponed as a result of the Monday sit-at-home order being enforced across the South-East. JAMB, which started last Friday, was slated to end today (Tuesday). However, it could not hold on Monday as the examination body shifted it to Wednesday to forestall tragedy. Majority of the examination centres in the state were under locks and keys on Monday morning. Due to the weekly sit-at-home, markets, banks and other business activities are usually shut down every Monday without vehicular movements until late in the afternoon. Entreaties by Governor Chukwuma Soludo that the residents of the state should ignore the sit-at-home  order on Mondays have yet to be heeded. Business activities and government offices are usually shut down on Mondays during the sit-at-home hours to avert attacks by hoodlums.
