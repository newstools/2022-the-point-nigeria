 The Lagos State Police Command, in conjunction with other sister security agencies in the state, has destroyed some illicit drugs valued at N10 million. Ahmed Kotangora, Deputy Commissioner of Police in charge of Operations in the Command, said that the drugs were destroyed at the dump site in Ewu-Elepe, a suburb of Ikorodu in Lagos State. The exercise was supervised by men of the Nigeria Police, NDLEA, NAFDAC, the Neighbourhood Watch and the state task force on environmental offences. The illicit drugs included 400 wraps of Indian Hemp and other hard drugs said to have been intercepted in April at Mile-2 area of Lagos State by officials of the Rapid Response Squad. Kotangora, who represented the Commissioner of Police in Lagos State, Abiodun Alabi, on the occasion, said that the exercise was in compliance with a court order to destroy the hard drugs. Three suspects were reportedly arrested in connection with the seizure.
