 Some residents, in Lagos, have risen against the attempt by the state government to demolish a distressed three-storey building at Number 100, Herbert Macaulay Way, Ebute-Meta. The inhabitants insisted that the state government should follow due process in arriving at the decision. It was gathered that the building was erected over 40 years ago. Olufemi Poluyi, former Supervisory Councillor, Lagos Mainland Local Government Area, representing other residents, said, “What will be the gain for the state government to render many family homeless on Eid-El Fitri Day? “The occupants should have been served quit notice before now. Failure to do this means that Lagos State Building Control Agency is not doing its job. “The officials have been passing through this area; how come they did not notice that a building was distressed?” The residents stopped the bulldozer from demolishing the building. Rescue operation was still on at the scene of the collapsed building at the time of filing this report.
