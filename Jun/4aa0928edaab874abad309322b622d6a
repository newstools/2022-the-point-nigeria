Police prosecutor, Inspector Fatoba Temitope, alleged that the defendant committed the offence with others now at large, on May 23, at about 3pm at Tanisi area, Osogbo. According to the charge sheet obtained in court, Moshood conspired among others at large to commit a felony to wit: unlawful possession of firearm and cartridge, an offence that is punishable under Section 516 of the Criminal Code, Cap 34, Volume II Laws of Osun State of Nigeria, 2002. It read that “Abdullahi Moshood on the same date, time, place and in the aforementioned magisterial district, did unlawfully have in your possession one locally made cut-to-size single barrel gun and thereby committed an offence contrary to Section 4 and punishable under Section 27(1)(b)(i) of the Firearms Act, Cap F.28 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 2004. “You (defendant) did unlawfully have in your possession one live cartridge and thereby committed an offence contrary to Section 4 and punishable under Section 27(1)(b)(ii) of the Firearms Act, Cap F.28 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 2004.” Moshood, however, pleaded not guilty to the counts.
