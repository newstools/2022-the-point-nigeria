 BY MAYOWA SAMUEL Three siblings identified as Oliseh, Daniel, and Destiny Egba, three, six, and eight years old respectively, have reportedly suffocated to death after they entered a parked Hyundai Accent car with registration number BDG404CL to play. The unfortunate incident occurred on Thursday evening at Gbamire Street, Owode Elede, Lagos State. Reports say the children, whose mother, Lorita Azibato, who lived at 2, Gbamire Street, were said to have been unable to come out of the vehicle, after they had wandered inside the complex where the vehicle was parked while playing. Witnesses said visitors who arrived to see the car owner, discovered the children. “No one knew they were inside the vehicle. It was some visitors who came to see the owner while looking at the vehicle that discovered them. When their bodies were brought out around 7pm, their mother was not back from the market. “Neighbours did not have her telephone number and so, the police had to wait until she returned home around 11:30pm to break the news to her. “Apparently, the children were not in the care of anyone else, the person in charge of them would have looked for them before their mother returned from the market.” Confirming the incident, the state police spokesman, Benjamin Hundeyin, said operatives attached to Owode Onirin received information around 7pm on Thursday that the young siblings were found inside the car lifeless. He said detectives immediately went to the scene, secured it for investigation and evacuated the bodies to the mortuary.
