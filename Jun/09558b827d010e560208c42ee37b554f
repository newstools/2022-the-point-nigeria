 BY MAYOWA SAMUEL The Supreme Court has overruled Lagos State on its restriction of the use of hijab by female Muslim students of public schools in the state. In a split decision of five to two of a seven-member panel on Friday, the Apex Court affirmed the July 21, 2016 judgment of the Lagos Court of Appeal, which set aside the October 17, 2014 judgment by Justice Grace Onyeabo of the High Court of Lagos State, which upheld the hijab restriction. Justice Kudirat Kekere-Ekun, who wrote the lead majority judgment, which was read on Friday by Justice Tijani Abubakar, dismissed the appeal filed by Lagos State against the 2016 judgment of the Court of Appeal, Lagos, on the grounds that the appeal was without merit. The Supreme Court said it found no reason to reinstate the October 17, 2014 judgement by Justice Grace Onyeabo of the High Court of Lagos State, which upheld the ban on Hijab.
