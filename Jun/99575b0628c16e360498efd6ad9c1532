 BY MAYOWA SAMUEL Former Anambra State Chief Judge, Peter Umeadi, has won the Presidential primary of the All Progressive Grand Alliance ahead of the 2023 general elections. The special convention took place on Wednesday at the Katampe-Abuja national headquarters of the party and his candidacy witnessed the emergence of Umeadi whose victory was affirmed by a total of 150 delegates by a voice vote. National chairman of the party, Victor Oye, thanked party members for attending the convention and expressed optimism that Umeadi would be sworn in as President, Federal Republic of Nigeria in 2023. In his acceptance speech, the retired professor of law promised to make Nigeria a great country every Nigerian would be proud of, if elected. Upon joining APGA in 2019, the ex-CJ stressed the need for an Igbo man to be given the opportunity to be president of Nigeria, saying ”It is only when an Igbo man is allowed to be in-charge of Nigeria for eight years, that things will get better. Igbos have the highest investment in Nigeria, and Nigerians must support them in their presidential bid in 2023, if things must move well.”
