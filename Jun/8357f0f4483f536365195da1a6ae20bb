 BY MAYOWA SAMUEL The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has rejected the All Progressives Congress (APC) primary that saw Godswill Akpabio emerge as the party’s candidate in the Akwa Ibom North-West senatorial district. Akpabio, who stepped down for Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, the ruling party’s presidential candidate, was proclaimed the victor of a senatorial primary held on Thursday. The state’s APC chairman, Stephen Ntukekpo, stated that he was asked by the national party to conduct a re-run due to alleged breaches. According to the results of the rerun senatorial primary election, Akpabio received 478 votes, while DIG Ekpo Udom (rtd) received only three votes in the first primary. However, the Resident Electoral Commissioner for Akwa Ibom State, Mike Igini, told a news media on Sunday, that the commission will only recognize the winner of the INEC-monitored primary. He denied that the commission was present at the re-run APC senatorial primary, in which Akpabio was declared the winner. “The primaries was concluded on the 27th of last month, so I don’t know what you are talking about. The one that was conducted was monitored by INEC and the report has been submitted to Abuja. “INEC is not aware of any senatorial primaries conducted on Thursday (June 9) that was monitored by INEC, none,” he stated.
