Breakdown of the sales transactions executed on June 6 and 7 on the floor of the Nigerian Exchange Limited showed that Otedola, a significant shareholder in FBN Holdings directly sold 200 million shares at N11.1 per share on June 6, amounting to about N2.22billion while other transactions were done under the cover of company vehicles that are linked to a significant shareholder. Details of the dealings provided by NGX Limited indicated Shetland Global, a company linked to the shareholder, also sold 974,939,764 ordinary shares at N11.40k per share on June 6, 2022, valued at about N11.12billion.

Otedola, the billionaire investor and chairman of Geregu Power Plant is officially the majority shareholder of FBN Holdings, one of Nigeria’s most respected banks and largest by branches. The much-anticipated audited accounts of the bank for the year ended December 2021 confirmed he owns 2,717,282,140 shares or 7.57 percent of the bank making him the single largest shareholder with more than 5% ownership of the bank. The bank’s 2022 first-quarter result which was released during the week also confirmed ownership of 2,717,282,140 shares or 7.57 percent of the bank’s total shares of 35,895,292,791. The disclosure in the audited accounts clarifies a protracted shareholder squabble that puts into question who the majority owner of one of the most systemic important financial institutions in Nigeria is.
