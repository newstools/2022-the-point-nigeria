 Newly promoted English Premier League side Fulham are looking to offer Porto €12million(N5.3billion) for the services of Super Eagles defender Zaidu Sanusi. Zaidu was brilliant for Porto last season scoring three goals in 40 appearances in all competitions. In fact, it was his whooping strike that guaranteed the Dragons a 30th Portugese league triumph. However, the Nigerian star is not the most famous name in Porto, as occasionally the fans have trolled him. Last summer he was linked with a move to Turkey, but nothing concrete emerged from the talks. The 24-years-old left-back has however attracted interest from the Premier League and Fulham are willing to offer Porto €12million(N5.3billion) for Sanusi’s services. The Cottagers are looking to make an impression on their return to the English top-flight under boss Marco Silva. The 44-year-old Portuguese tactician is known to be a lover of attacking football, and Sanusi could be a fine recruitment as the Nigerian star loves to bump forward. However, getting Sanusi could be a tough task as Porto may not listen to offer less than €20miilion for the Super Eagles defender.
