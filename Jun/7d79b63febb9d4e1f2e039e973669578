 BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO The July 16 governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party In Osun State, Ademola Adeleke has said the ‘stolen mandate of the people of the state in 2018’ would be recovered in the coming poll. Adeleke, while addressing members of the ruling All Progressives Congress who were led to the PDP in Osogbo by Kolapo Alimi, a loyalist of Rauf Aregbesola, on Wednesday also expressed confidence that the election would be devoid of rigging owing to the new Electoral Act. Reacting to the crowd of detectors that thronged the PDP secretariat, Adeleke said, “I feel so good, the impression is great and as you can see, this crowd is not a fake crowd, it’s not a wretched crowd, this is for real. Osun is moving, Osun is talking. They are saying loud and clear they want ‘Imole’ right now. “I give glory to Almighty God, I give glory to Almighty Allah too. Everyday people are coming, there are some more we cannot even mention here, all over Osun State. Because in 2018, they stole the mandate of the people and the people are ready to fight for their mandate. So, the stolen mandate, by the special grace of God, the people of Osun are going to get it back come July 16. When asked if he was concerned about the election being rigged, Adeleke said, “Well, I thank the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, President Buhari who signed the Electoral Law that has already decreased rigging. So, I believe that a lot of people of Osun State are more wise, they are ready to defend their votes. So, I don’t believe it is going to be possible. “It’s not by force to rule, people have to decide who they want and I believe it is me, Senator Ademola Nurudeen Adeleke. “The chances of PDP are growing, let me just say 80%, and I thank you (journalists) so much for your cooperation,” the PDP candidate added.
