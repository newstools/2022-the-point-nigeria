 BY MAYOWA SAMUEL In fulfillment of its earlier vow, the Lagos State Government on Friday crushed about 2,000 impounded motorcycles popularly known as Okada, at the Taskforce’s Crushing Centre, Ikeja. About 2,000 motorcycles have already been impounded in the last 72 hours since commencement of the total ban. The Commissioner for Transportation, Frederic Oladeinde, explained that the idea was to prevent the Okadas from finding their way back into the streets. Oladeinde, who supervised the crushing exercise, commended the security operatives for doing a great job in enforcing the total ban across all the affected 15 local councils. Stating that the crushing was to demonstrate the government’s commitment to ridding the State of Okada menace, the commissioner added that Friday’s exercise brought to about 7,000 the total number of Okadas already crushed by the government in the last five months. Disclosing that about 5,000 had earlier been crushed in the First Quarter of 2022, Oladeinde urged Lagosians to stop patronising Okada and to use the alternative First and Last Mile Buses provided by the government. Responding to complaints from Apapa where the people are finding it tough due to the Okada ban, the commissioner advised that people should show more understanding as the directive was in the interest of all citizens of the state.
