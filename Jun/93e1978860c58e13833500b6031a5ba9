 BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO The governorship candidate of the Social Democratic Party, Segun Oni, has alleged vote-buying in some polling units in Ado-Ekiti and Oye-Ekiti. He called on security agencies to curb the malpractice. Oni, while addressing journalists after casting his vote said, “Everything has been going on smoothly but we heard that buying and selling of votes are ongoing in Ado and Oye-Ekiti. We have notified security agencies because it’s against the law to buy and sell votes. On the rumour that he had stepped down in the race, he said, “that’s not true. Those who are speculating that are sick. They know we are ahead of them. It’s only the person ahead they would concort such false information against me because they know I will be victorious. “If they say the frontrunner has withdrawn without any reason and even if the first runner will withdraw, there must be solid reasons and they have started this about a week ago because public opinions are against them. “They said I met with Asiwaju at a location in Akure, they did a photoshop of me and him, putting us together as if we took a photograph together. I haven’t seen Asiwaju face to face for at least one or two years. So, they will say anything, they will.do anything, the truth is that they are under heat. I am confident of winning this election and everybody knows who will win. They will try all tricks and all forms of rigging but everybody knows who will win. This propaganda will not affect the results of the election because no one will believe them,” Oni said.
