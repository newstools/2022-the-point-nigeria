 BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO A 57-year-old estate agent, Ifeoluwa Oloyede, has been dragged before a Chief Magistrate Court sitting in Osogbo, Osun State for allegedly swindling a resident of the state. Oloyede was said to have obtained the sum of N70, 000 from one Yinus Aliyu with a promise to secure an apartment for him. Aliyu later reported Oloyede to the police for breach of agreement. The charge brought against the defendant read that “You, Ifeoluwa Oloyede, on December 18, 2021 at Sabo area, Osogbo, did fraudulently obtain the sum of N70, 000 only from one Yinus Aliyu under the pretext of helping him to secure a room and parlour, the representation you knew was false thereby committing an offence contrary to and punishable under Section 419 of the Criminal Code, Cap 34, Volume II, Laws of Osun State, 2002. “You (defendant), on the same date, time, and place, did steal the sum of N70,000 only, property of one Yinus Aliyu and thereby committed an offence contrary to Section 383 and punishable under Section 390(9) of Criminal Code, Cap 34, Volume II, Laws of Osun State 2002.” The defendant pleaded not guilty to the two-count-charge. His counsel, Tunbosun Oladipupo, urged the court to grant Oloyede bail and assured that he would not abuse the privilege. Police prosecutor, Inspector Adeoye Kayode, objected to the bail application on the ground that it was difficult for the police to arrest the defendant in the first instance. Chief Magistrate Sola Aluko granted the accused person bail in the sum of N50, 000 with one surety in the same amount. The court ordered that the surety, who must be resident within its jurisdiction, must present three-year-tax-clearance. The matter was adjourned till June 22 for hearing.
