 BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, has congratulated his estranged political godfather, Bola Tinubu over his victory at the just concluded presidential primary election of the ruling All Progressives Congress. In a congratulatory message he personally issued, Aregbesola, a former governor of Osun State who had been in cold war with Tinubu, humbled himself and identified with the victory of the former Lagos State Governor. Addressing Tinubu, the minister said, “I write to felicitate with you on your hard fought victory at the just concluded Presidential Primary election of our great party, the All Progressives Congress (APC). “You have demonstrated once again that you are a dogged fighter and in your quest for the establishment of a democratic society, you are willing to go the whole hog. “It is my prayer that you will ride on the crest of the momentum of this triumph to lead our party to victory in next year’s General Elections. “On behalf of my family and our associates, I heartily congratulate you on this well deserved victory. Congratulations sir.”
