 The management of Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company Plc has appealed to its numerous customers in some parts of Ogun State over power outage. This is contained in  a statement made available to the News Agency of Nigeria by Akin Abiodun, the Chief Technical Officer and an  Engineer in Ibadan on Saturday. He apologised for the disruption in supply, stating  that the outage was due to a heavy fault on a 33kV line that had a backlash on the grounding transformer at the TCN Sub-station at Papalanto. According to him,  work is in progress to restore  supply to communities, including Papalanto, Arigbajo, Ejio, Ifo, Agosi, Olomu road, Ososun village, Coker, Akinside, Ibogun, Oju-sango, Pakoto, Babyoku, Agebgise, Ogun bade, Iyana Cele, Iyana Ilogbo, Owode, Ijako, Isorosi, Ishaka Igbala and several others. He said the grounding transformers which were under the transformer’s protection had to be replaced before supply could be restored. “Our technical teams are working assiduously with their TCN counterparts to ensure power supply is restored as soon as possible,” Abiodun said. He further explained that IBEDC was sensitive to the effects of the outage on the customers. “Once again we sincerely apologise for the inconvenience and seek for the understanding and patience of all in the affected communities,” Abiodun said.
