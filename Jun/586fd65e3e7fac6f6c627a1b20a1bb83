 BY BENEDICT NWACHUKWU,ABUJA The Presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu, will today announce his running mate as the deadline given by the Independent National Electoral Commission draws to a close. INEC has fixed 6:00pm, Friday June 17 as the deadline for the uploading of parties’ candidates. The party which has settled for a Muslim/Muslim ticket has equally favoured the North East zone to produce the Vice Presidential candidate. Inside sources close to the former Lagos State governor disclosed that he has been in closed doors meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari to finalise the choice of who must be a younger person from among the youth in his 50s saying that both the President and the candidate have the sole right to choose the running mate. “I can assure you that Asiwaju and President Buhari have been meeting on this. The Presidential candidate has the right to choose his running mate. The only person he will discuss it with is the President and I can confidently tell you that he has done that. “There will be no setting up of a committee to decide who will be Tinubu’s running mate. The party will not force anyone on him. He knows every member of the party. He knows who he can work with to win the election and equally, who he can work with after winning as a loyal subordinate,” he said. Further investigation revealed that the former Secretary of the Buhari Support Group and ally of the President from the days of Congress for Progressive Change, Ibrahim Bello Dauda, might have been favoured for the position. Dauda, a management consultant from Borno State is said to have the support of party chieftains especially the CPC bloc since the New PDP and the ACN have taken the National Chairman and presidential tickets respectively.
