 BY ANDREW EKEJIUBA Enoch Tochukwu Nwali has emerged winner of the just concluded Emmanuel Egbele Annual Scrabble Tournament (EEAST) in Lagos. The Point gathered that he dedicated the victory to his parents, friends and course mates at the University of Lagos (UNILAG). “I will dedicate this sweet win to my parents, they have been very supportive right from the first day I started playing scrabble and also my friends and course mates in UNILAG, they are my source of inspiration and encouragement,” he said. Nwali defeated a strong field of 28 Masters Players that included World Champion, African Kings and West Africa title holders. He also defeated Jighere Wellington back-to-back to win the converted trophy with 12 +749 cumulative points. Nwali who joined the scrabble family some eleven years ago through his Secondary School principal won 12 out of the 16 games in the two-day competition. He explained that it was a dream come true winning in such a heavy cast of tested hands in the game. “I didn’t do anything spectacular but I maintained my composure and focused throughout the tournament. It means I could actually top Nigerian scrabble one day and get to the apex,” he enthused. He added that EEAST Masters win will surely lubricate his goal, dream and passion for the game of words and mind. Nwali, a member of the all conquering and dreaded Team Nigeria’s squad to the just concluded West Africa Scrabble Championship is looking forward to the forthcoming Baylesa Championship.
