 BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO Among residents of some towns in Ekiti State who arrived early at polling units to cast their votes were elderly men and women and persons living with disabilities. As early as 9:00am, these set of people converged at their voting points while armed with their Permanent Voters Cards. Some of the physically impaired voters were assisted for accreditation while relatives who accompanied them to their polling units led them to exercise their voting rights. The elderly people were happy to participate in the process in some of the areas monitored.
