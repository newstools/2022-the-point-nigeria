 Paris-Saint Germain are set to part ways with Argentine manager Mauricio Pochettino. Reports claim the Ligue 1 giants and the Argentine arrived at the agreement following a meeting last week. Taking charge of the 10-time Ligue 1 champions in January 2021, the former Southampton and Espanyol manager’s time in Paris has lasted a little over 12-months. Despite the 50-year-old’s time in Paris likely to divide opinion, he did guide the side to three trophies, including the 2021-22 Ligue 1 title. However, crashing out of the Champions League during the first knockout round against Real Madrid was probably the deciding factor when it came to deciding the South American’s long-term future.
