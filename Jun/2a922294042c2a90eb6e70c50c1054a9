 Real Madrid has announced that it would be holding a farewell event at the club’s training ground on Monday for their Brazilian star, Marcelo. Accompanied by his family and President Florentino Perez, Marcelo will be present for a tribute ceremony and homage, before holding a final press conference as a Real Madrid player. The Los Blancos completed a league and Champions League double in the final weekend of May and for their captain, it must have been a bittersweet experience. Marcelo knew that it would be his last game for the club and that his final act would be to lift the Champions League trophy, bringing a curtain down on a remarkable period of success for the Brazilian. Marcelo arrived at the Santiago Bernabeu in 2006 and in the past 16 years has won 25 titles, making him the most decorated player in the Spanish side’s history. For almost a decade, Marcelo was a constant source of entertainment on the left flank of the teams.
