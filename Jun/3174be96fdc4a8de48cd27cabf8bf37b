The activist, who made this disclosure on his verified Facebook page, lamented that Nigerians were not ready to make the desired change in the country adding that those mounting PVC collection revolution on social media should not be taken seriously. He said, “Nigerians are not ready. Don’t let the trends on social media deceive you. The reality on ground is beyond sad. On the phone with our LGAs & some Ward coordinators in Ekiti, the situation is beyond depressing. “A pot of soup is what they are selling a 4 year mandate for in Ekiti.” Meanwhile, some voters who were on a queue at Unit 001 in Ado-Ekiti were seen saying that they were tired of selling their votes in the past and resolved not to sell their votes at the current poll.
