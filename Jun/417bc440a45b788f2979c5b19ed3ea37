 BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO A retired public school teacher in Iwara, Atakunmosa West Local Government Area of  Osun State, has taken to alms begging for survival. In a viral video sighted by our correspondent on Friday, the man who is physically impaired was being led on the streets of Ilesa by a teenage girl to beg for alms. As empathic passersby and traders were giving him money, the man was narrating his ordeal of how he had been denied of his entitlements by the state government adding that he couldn’t have resorted to begging for survival of not for his mysterious blindness. He said, “I wouldn’t have come out to beg for alms if I was seeing with my eyes. I came out because of my blindness and hunger, please, have mercy upon me and help me. “I worked for 35 years as a teacher in Iwara and it’s this same Iwara that I was struck with blindness. I worked for eight years in Iwara and after retirement, I was denied of my entitlements. “I contributed over two million naira while in active service but till date, I have not received a dime. Please, help me, God will help you too. I wouldn’t have come out to beg if I was seeing,” he narrated in emotion-laden voice.
