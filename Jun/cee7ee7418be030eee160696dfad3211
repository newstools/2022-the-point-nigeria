 BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO Scores of commuters have stranded after members of Tipper Drivers Association blocked the River Niger Bridge also known as Head Bridge, over alleged extortion. The protesting drivers were said to have used their vehicles to shut the busy roads after accusing naval officers of always extorting N1,000 from them. The protest started in the early hours of Saturday after naval officers shot and destroyed the tyres of one of the tippers after the driver refused to bribe them. Meanwhile, travellers plying the Head Bridge have narrated their ordeals since the road was shut. One of the affected travellers, a shoe trader who simply identified himself as Sunday, told our correspondent on the telephone that he and other commuters returning from Aba in Abia State and other parts of the Southeast, have been trapped in the road blockage since around 8am. It was gathered further that the protesting tipper drivers had sworn not to remove their vehicles on the road until the military men leave the road and stop extorting them.
