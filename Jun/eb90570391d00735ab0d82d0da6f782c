 BY MAYOWA SAMUEL Swiss tennis legend, Roger Federer is hopeful to recover in time from his latest knee surgery and return to the ATP circuit next season. Disclosing this on Sunday to a Swiss media, the 20-time Grand Slam title winner had been out of action since a quarter-final defeat at Wimbledon almost a year ago. The former world number one who will be 41 in August is currently nursing his third injury in 18 months. On his expected comeback, Federer said, “How, why and to do what, I don’t yet know, but that would be the idea.” “I myself am curious to see what will follow. But I have hope, I have already come a long way. I’m not far. The next three or four months will be extremely important,” he added. He explained that he was “currently focusing on (his) physical condition so that there is no overload” and goes to the gym “five to six times a week”. He is aiming for a return to action at the Laver Cup in London from September 23-25 and then his hometown tournament of Basel from October 24-30. Federer, the winner of 103 trophies over his career, played only 13 matches in 2021 and just six in 2020. He is currently ranked 50th in ATP standings, his lowest in 22 years.
