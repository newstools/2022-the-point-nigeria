 BY MAYOWA SAMUEL The Ondo State Government has cancelled this year’s June 12 celebration, initially scheduled on Sunday, June 12, 2022. The revocation became necessary, due to a panic assault on naive parishioners at St. Francis Catholic Church in Owo on Sunday, June 5, 2022. According to the Governor’s Chief Press Secretary, Richard Olatunde, the cancellation is to enable the entire people of Ondo State to grieve their loved ones who died in the terrible incident. Gunmen had last Sunday meted out terror on Owo when they raged a church where worshipers had assembled for the Pentecost day. After the fatal attack, no fewer than 40 people were killed and others sustained varying degrees of injuries. In honor of the victims of the terror attack, Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu directed that all flags in the state be flown at half-mast for seven days.
