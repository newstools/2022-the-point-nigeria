 BY MAYOWA SAMUEL The World Bank has estimated that pollution kills at least 30,000 people in Lagos every year. The Washington-based bank disclosed this in a feature story on its blog, titled ‘Making Lagos a Pollution Free City: Solving the threat one solution at a time’. According to the bank, pollution is a huge problem in many cities globally, including Lagos, which is notorious for its large population, high concentration of motor vehicles and industrial pollution. The bank further said that an estimated 20 million people live on an area of less than 100 square kilometres in Lagos, which leads to a suffocating mix of air pollution, single-use plastic pollution and solid waste in the city’s streets causing respiratory problems, floodings and other illnesses among the locals. On the effect of pollution in Lagos, the lending bank said, “The causes of the pollution are many, and the pollution has many effects on the environment. It is estimated that at least 30,000 people die every year in Lagos due to pollution.” It added, “Air pollution in 2020 in Lagos was responsible for over 30,000 premature deaths and more than half were infants of less than one year old.” The bank further warned about the economic costs of exposure to lead aerosol in Ikorodu, which are estimated at an additional $300–$600m or $400–$600 for every resident of that LGA.
