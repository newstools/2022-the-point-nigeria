 National chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Abdullahi Adamu, said on Saturday that the party will punish one of its presidential aspirants, Bola Tinubu, for his recent utterances against President Muhammadu Buhari. Tinubu had claimed on Thursday during his consultation visit to Abeokuta, Ogun State, that he helped the President and other APC leaders to win elections in 2015. The former governor of Lagos State has however, issued another statement to apologise to the President. While briefing newsmen at the national secretariat of APC in Abuja, Adamu said the apology tendered by Tinubu was not enough. “We may punish him (Tinubu) for his utterances against the President,” Adamu said.
