 BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO No fewer than 2,203 accredited delegates of the ruling All Progressives Congress are set to elect the party’s presidential flagbearer. According to Abubakar Badaru, those who had already withdrawn form the race and stepped down for their fellow aspirants would not be voted for in the exercise. Badaru said the voting would be in alphabetical order as Abia delegates would kick start the voting.
