 BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO Some of the people living with albinism and other disabilities have expressed worry over the failure of the Independent National Electoral Commission to provide assistive devices and materials to enable them exercise their voting rights in the ongoing governorship election in Ekiti State. They said the electoral body did not consider their plights and conditions in their plannings adding that they could not get assistive devices such as magnified glasses and Braille. “This is another election and it’s sad that INEC didn’t consider us. I am an albino and it was very difficult for me to go through the ballot paper before I could cast my vote,” an albino voter said in Ado-Ekiti. “Before now, our national leadership had always called on INEC to make adequate provisions for albinos, the blind and other critical persons living with disabilities. But, what it’s happening is not good. For instance, there was no magnified glasses for me and it was very difficult for me to see my preferred political party to vote for,” he lamented. A physically impaired elderly voter was said to have caused confusion at at Fajuyi House, Polling 007, Ado Ekiti, after he requested for help to be able to identify the logo of her preferred party. Following absence of Braille at the polling unit, the situation led to a shouting march among agents of political parties at the poll.
