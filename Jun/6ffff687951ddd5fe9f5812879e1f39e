 BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO One of the strongest loyalists of Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola and former Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs during Aregbesola’s tenure in Osun State, Kolapo Alimi, has finally dumped the ruling All Progressives Congress. It was gathered that Alimi has been appointed as Deputy Director General, Ademola Adeleke Campaign Organisation, a group canvassing votes for Senator Adeleke, the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party for the July 16 election in Osun State. His appointment was confirmed by the Director General of the campaign council, Sunday Bisi. It would be recalled that Alimi had earlier denied moving to the leading opposition party when the news of his planned defection broke sometimes in the month of April. He said that the jingle announcing his defection to PDP was leaked. A jingle that went viral on the social media had claimed that Alimi would defect to the PDP alongside his 25,000 supporters from across the state. The jingle which eulogised Alimi’s political prowess, also said that the formal event where he would be received into the PDP by the party’s governorship candidate, Ademola Adeleke, would hold on Thursday, March 23, 2022. However, when contacted for further clarification, Alimi, who is the current Secretary of The Osun Progressives, a faction in the All Progressives Congress in Osun, backed by Aregbesola, simply said, “for now, we have a tendency, we have leaders who are talking to us, guiding us on what to do.” Confirming the news, Alimi who spoke to our correspondent on phone said he’s now a bonafide member of PDP. “Yes, it’s correct. I’m now a bonafide member of PDP and I have been appointed as Deputy Director General, Senator Ademola Adeleke Campaign Organization. My teeming supporters are also going with me. Thanks,” he said.
