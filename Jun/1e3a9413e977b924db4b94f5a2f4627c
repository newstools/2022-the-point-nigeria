 BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO A non-governmental organisation, Anchor Heritage Empowerment Initiative on Monday distributed food and other items to inmates of Ilesa Correctional Centre to celebrate this year’s Democracy Day. The male and female inmates could not hide their joy after receiving the gifts. Speaking, the Co-founder and Chief Operating Officer of the NGO, Bidemi Oladipupo, said the gesture was to prove to the inmates that the society has not forgotten them. Oladipupo said food items of different types were shared to the inmates to mark June 12 adding that it was part of the organisation’s efforts at rehabilitating and spreading love to those in custodial centres. “We were at the Ilesa Custodial Centre to celebrate democracy day as a fallout of our #spreadtheloveinitiative with the male and female inmates. We shared items to all inmates in the facility and it was all shades of glory. “These inmates need to be shown love and care and this was exactly what we have done in the spirit of Democracy Day. We hope that someday, when they are out to the society, they would remember this show of love and love as more responsible citizens. We won’t relent in making impacts and also showing these inmates that they are not forgotten,” Oladipupo said.
