 BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO A Magistrate’s Court sitting in Osogbo, the Osun State capital, has ordered the remand of two suspects for allegedly stealing a hammer and other working tools valued at N1, 325,000. The two defendants, Olajide Olasile, aged 22; and Nurudeen Adekunle, 21; were said to have conspired to commit the act on April 18, at GMT area of Osogbo. They allegedly stole a complete hammer and bit valued at N700,000, extra bit valued at N250,000, a clay-cutter valued at N65,000, an adaptor valued at N110,000 and a hammer barrel valued at N200,000, property of one Ojerinde Idowu. The police prosecutor, Inspector Fatoba Temitope, who put the total cost of the stolen items at N1, 325,000, said that Olasile and Adekunle fled to Kwara State after committing the offence. They were found to have committed offences contrary to and punishable under sections 516 and 390(9) of the Criminal Code, Cap 34, Volume Il Laws of Osun State of Nigeria 2002. The defence counsel, Kehinde Adepoju, pleaded with the magistrate to grant the accused persons bail with an assurance that they would be available in court as and when due to stand trial. However, Temitope objected to the bail application on the ground that the police tracked the defendants to Kwara State before being arrested through intelligence information and technologies. According to him, they would abuse the bail privilege if granted. Temitope urged the court to discountenance the application. Magistrate M.A Olatunji denied the defendants bail but ordered that they be remanded in Ilesa Correctional Centre. She adjourned the matter till July 24 for hearing.
