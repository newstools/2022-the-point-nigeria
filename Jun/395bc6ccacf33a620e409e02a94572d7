 Sadio Mane did not let speculation about his Liverpool future impact him on international duty, scoring a hat-trick to set a new Senegal goal scoring record at the weekend. Mane scored three goals in a 3-1 win over Benin with ten men in a 2023 Africa Cup of Nations qualification, surpassing Henri Camara with 31 goals in 86 games. The 30-year-old contract at Anfield expires in a year, and he has been linked with a move to Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich. Before the game, the forward quipped that he would follow the advice of his fellow countrymen on social media. In Diamniadio, Mane scored a penalty early on and added a second from close range midway through the first half. Mane completed his hat-trick on the hour mark after Benin midfielder Sessi D’Almeida was sent off, however the visitors pulled one back late on through Junior Olaitan. Senegal won the African Cup of Nations for the first time in February, with Mane scoring the shootout winner against Egypt, and Aliou Cisse’s side topped Group L to begin their defence of the championship. Madagascar and Rwanda, who drew on Thursday, are two points behind the Teranga Lions.
