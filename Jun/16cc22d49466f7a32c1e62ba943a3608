 BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO Operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission on Saturday arrested some persons alleged to be engaged in vote buying at the ongoing governorship election in Ekiti State. The anti-graft agents also seized some bags and envelopes filled with money. Other items recovered from the suspects included some sheets of papers containing names, polling units and PVC identification numbers of voters. The commission officers paraded the suspected vote-buyers including male and female. Meanwhile, a woman, Muyibat, burst into tears in polling unit 002, Ward 2, Sabo area of Ijero Local Government Area of the state after she allegedly voted for a political party and wasn’t paid. She said she voted the All Progressives Congress and wasn’t given money. In the video obtained by our correspondent, an APC agent reportedly instructed a man called Lapo to go and give her money.
