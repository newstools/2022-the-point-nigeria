 Nigerian attacking midfielder and winger Malcolm Ebiowei is reportedly nearing an exit from demoted Championship club Derby County. Reports revealed that the Rams have identified Tom Barkhuizen as a possible replacement for the Arsenal academy product. Signed from Scottish club Rangers last summer, Ebiowei has entered the last one month of his contract with The Rams and it’s unlikely he will extend his stay at the Pride Park Stadium beyond June 30, 2022. Manchester United are monitoring the situation of the 2019 Golden Eaglets invitee and the exciting teenager is also on the radar of Crystal Palace this summer. Although manager Wayne Rooney would like to retain the services of Ebiowei, Derby County cannot offer a new deal to the Nigerian until the takeover of the club is completed. The future of the 18-year-old has been the subject of speculation in recent weeks on the back of his outstanding performance for Derby in the second half of the 2021-2022 season after he forced his way into the first team picture. In sixteen outings in the second tier, Ebiowei scored once and set up two goals, and was in action for 954 minutes.
