 BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO The Nigeria Police Force on Saturday announced that it has deployed additional policemen to support the about 17,000 of their colleagues already sent to ensure peace and order in the state as the governorship election is currently ongoing. The Force Public Relations Officer, Olumuyiwa Adejobi, who made this disclosure in a live video he posted on his verified Facebook page on Saturday, said the force now has enough men on ground to continue patrolling and surveiling for seamless election. Adejobi didn’t disclose the number of the newly deployed policemen. “I want to inform you that the Nigeria Police Force has deployed additional men for Ekiti State Governorship Election. They will join those already on ground to survey other areas. “This is done to ensure seamless election exercise in Ekiti State. We have the Nigerian Army, the DSS, Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, Correctional Service, Immigration Service, Federal Road Safety Corps, Fire Service and other security agencies here (Ekiti). “We are forming a very strong synergy here today to ensure successful exercise. Like I said earlier, this security agencies are not to intimidate anybody, we want the people of Ekiti State to know that we are for them and to provide adequate security for them. “This is also to send a message to those who might want to foment trouble that there won’t be room for that. If you don’t have any business coming out, please stay in your house. If you don’t have your voter’s cards, you don’t have any business coming out. Stay glued to your TV and listen to music. “We are here for you. We don’t practise politics. We are here to do our business, don’t be intimidated, don’t feel harrassed by our presence, we are here for you. We will continue to move and update you. Today’s election will be a success. Thank you,” Adejobi assured.
