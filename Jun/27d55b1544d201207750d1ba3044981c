 BY MAYOWA SAMUEL As part of measures to contain the spread of the monkeypox virus in the country, the Federal government has banned trans-border transportation of bush meat in the country and directed ‘bush meat’ sellers to suspend their business. The Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Mohammad Abubakar disclosed this in a statement on Tuesday, following reported cases and a fatality arising from the monkeypox outbreak in the country. The Nigerian Centre for Disease Control on Monday announced the death of a 40-year-old who contracted monkeypox. His death was one of 21 cases confirmed by the NCDC on Sunday. Urging people in the country to avoid contact with persons suspected to have the virus, the minister said his ministry worked with the NCDC and other stakeholders to ensure the virus did not spread. He also called on veterinary clinics, veterinary teaching hospitals, and other veterinary health institutions to be vigilant in picking possible signs and symptoms of monkeypox in non-human primate (NHP) patients. He also advised silos, stores, and other agricultural storage facilities to institute active rodent control measures to prevent contact and possible contamination of monkeypox virus with foodstuff. The minister appealed to operators of zoos, parks, conservation, and recreational centres keeping non-human primates, to ensure strict compliance with their biosecurity protocols to prevent their contact with humans. He said, “We must also ensure regular hand washing using strong disinfectant anytime we handle NHP and rodents in our various locations. “We must also discourage the act of consumption, trade and keeping of NHP and rodents as pets in our homes. “The general public is advised to report any pox-like lesions seen on humans or animals to the nearest human or veterinary clinics.” Bush meat in Nigeria means all animals not reared at home but hunted and killed in the bush for human consumption.
