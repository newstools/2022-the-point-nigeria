 The Senator representing Ogun Central, Ibikunle Amosun, has expressed sadness over the death of a former Chairman of Sagamu Local Government and prominent member of the All Progressives Congress in Ogun State, Femi Felix Kafaru, who died on Tuesday, June 14, 2022. Amosun, in a statement from his media office and signed by Bola Adeyemi, described Kafaru, popularly known as ‘Femi Soja’ as a dedicated and committed party man. He said Kafaru was a loyal democrat, highly resourceful grassroots politician and a relentless ‘soldier of democracy.’ “His death is a personal loss to me, members of our political family and the entire APC in Ogun State. We will miss his contributions to the development of APC in Sagamu, Ogun East and Ogun State as a whole. “Femi Soja was a courageous fighter of justice and defender of his people. He gave his all to the service of humanity during his glorious career in the Nigerian Army and in the political space of Ogun State, particularly when he served as a Caretaker Chairman, APC Chairman and Executive Chairman of Sagamu Local Government Area of Ogun State.” While commiserating with his widows, children, aged parents and the entire Kafaru Family, Amosun prayed that Almighty Allah (SWT) will grant him Aljannah Firdau and give his family and the entire APC members in Ogun State the fortitude to bear the pain of his loss.
