 BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO The Police in Osun State have dragged a 28-year-old man, Segun Abayomi, before a Magistrate Court in Ilesa over allegations of theft and multiple assaults of some persons. Abayomi was accused by a resident of Ilesa, William Okon, of stealing a phone valued at N31, 000 on January 9, 2022 at Oke-Esho area. Okon was said to have lodged a complaint of alleged stealing of his Itel P15 phone at the Area B Police Division, Ijamo, Ilesa. The suspect was later alleged of fighting and slapping the complainant. Abayomi was said to have bitten Inspector Eunice Ayoola, a female police officer at the station, who attempted to stop him from assaulting Okon.
Police prosecutor, Inspector Matthew Adebayo, told the court that Abayomi caused his colleague (Ayoola) harm on her shoulder in the process.
The charge against the defendant read that “Abayomi Segun, on January 9, at about 4pm at Oke-Esho Street, Ilesa, did steal an Itel P15 phone valued at N31,000 property of one William Okon. “That Abayomi, on January 11, at about 10am at ‘B’ Division, Ijamo Area, Ilesa did assault one William Okon by fighting and wrestling him and slapped him on his face at the police station in Ijamo, Ilesa. “Abayomi, on the same date, time and place, did unlawfully assault one Woman Inspector, Eunice Ayoola, a member of the Nigeria Police Force attached to ‘B’ Division Ilesa by giving her a human bite on her right shoulder and harming her.”
Adebayo submitted that Abayomi committed offences contrary to Section 383 and punishable under sections 390, 351 and 356 of the Criminal Code, Cap 34, Volume II, Laws of Osun, 2002. However, the defendant (without any legal representation), pleaded not guilty to the charges preferred against him. Magistrate O. A. Oloyede granted the defendant bail in the sum of N200, 000 with two sureties in the same amount. He was taken to Ilesa Correctional Centre for failing to meet the bail conditions.
The matter was adjourned till January 31 for mention.
