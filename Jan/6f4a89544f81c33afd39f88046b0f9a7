 BY FOLASHADE KEHINDE A high court in Umuahia, Abia State, has ordered the Federal Government and the Nigeria Army to pay N1billion to the Leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu, for invading his house in September 2017. The Federal Government and the Army were also ordered to apologise to Kanu for the violation of his fundamental rights. Justice Benson Anya gave the ruling on Wednesday while delivering judgement on the suit filed by Kanu against the Federal Government, the Nigeria Army and others. Kanu, who is currently in the custody of the Department of State Services, filed the suit through his counsel, Aloy Ejimakor. The suit was filed against Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, and the DSS over the alleged violation of his fundamental human rights. Other respondents are FGN (1st defendant), Chief of Army Staff (3rd), Inspector-General of Police (5th), and three others. In the suit, marked ‘HIH/FR14/2021’, Kanu prayed the court to compel the respondents to pay him N5 billion damages as monetary compensation for the “physical, mental, emotional, psychological and other damages” he suffered as a result of the alleged infringement on his fundamental rights.
