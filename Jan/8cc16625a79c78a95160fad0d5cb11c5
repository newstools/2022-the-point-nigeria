 A former minister, Oby Ezekwesili, has said that the citizens of Nigeria have the collective power to stop politicians like a former Governor of Lagos State, Bola Tinubu from occupying the presidential seat. In a tweet on Tuesday, the 2019 presidential aspirant wondered if Nigerians are ready to collectively stop Tinubu. She tweeted, “It is citizens that have the power to collectively tell the likes of Mr. Bola Tinubu that the season of lowest common denominator of political leaders doing “turn-by-turn” incompetent governance of Nigeria is over.” “The question is, “are citizens ready to collectively do so?” — Oby Ezekwesili (@obyezeks) January 11, 2022
