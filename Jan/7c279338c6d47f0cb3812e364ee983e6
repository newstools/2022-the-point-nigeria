 BY BENEDICT NWACHUKWU, ABUJA The national secretary of the All Progressives Congress Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, Senator John Akpanudoedehe, has debunked the news making the rounds that the party has zoned its offices saying that the party has not even met on that issue. Akpanudodehe told the media that the circulating news about zoning of party positions is not true. “We have not zoned any office. In fact we have not even met on that. Therefore, any news saying APC has zoned one office or the other should be disregarded because there is no truth in it.” He noted that the CECPC will release a detailed time table shortly.
