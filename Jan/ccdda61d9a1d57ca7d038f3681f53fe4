 BY BENEDICT NWACHUKWU, ABUJA The All Progressives Congress has recorded landmark reconciliation between the Governor of Gombe State Mohammed Inuwa Yahaya and a former Governor of the state, Mohammed Danjuma Goje. The reconciliatory meeting chaired by the Chairman Caretaker Committee and Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni with the party’s National Reconciliation Committee Chairman, Abdullahi Adamu and a member of the Committee, Kashim Shettima. The Gombe state political gladiators were at meeting for the first time after a political clash in the state last year. “The successful reconciliation has further stamped the authority of the party in the state,” Buni said. He expressed delight with the resolution of the differences between the two chieftains. “The party will continue to explore and exploit ways of resolving differences among stakeholders amicably across the country for a united front ahead of the 2023 general elections. “I am indeed very happy with this development and this style would be replicated to solve the problems in other states,” he said. The Chairman commended Adamu and the untiring commitment of his members to settling differences among the stakeholders. He also commended Yahaya and Goje for placing the party interest and that of Gombe State over and above personal interests. Buni urged supporters of Yahaya and Goje to help cement the relationship. “You should contribute to cementing a healthy relationship between the two leaders in the interest of the party,” he charged.
