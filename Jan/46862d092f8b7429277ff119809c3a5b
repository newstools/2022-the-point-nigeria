 BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO The Police in Osun State have arraigned two businesswomen, Toyin Omobolarin, 40; and Tawa Awosise, 42, before a Magistrate Court sitting in Ile-Ife for allegedly burgling their colleague’s shop and stealing the sum of N550,000. Police prosecutor, Inspector Onah Glory, told the court that the defendants committed the offence on November 19, 2021 at the Itamerin area of Ile-Ife. Glory said that the two women conspired with each other to commit a felony to break into the shop of a fellow trader, Jumoke Hamzat, and stole the sum of N550, 000 that Hamzat kept in therein. According to the prosecutor, the shop owner said that the allegedly stolen money belonged to one Muritala Ayinde. The offence contravened sections 383, 390(9), 413 and 516 of the Criminal Code, Cap 34 Volume II, Laws of Osun State, 2002. The defendants, however, pleaded not guilty to the three-count charge of conspiracy, shop breaking and stealing. The defence counsel, Joseph Amole, pleaded for bail for the defendants in the most liberal term, assuring the court that the duo would not jump bail if granted. Magistrate O. B. Adediwura granted the defendants bail in the sum of N500, 000 with two sureties each in like sum. Adediwura added that the sureties must swear to affidavit of means, must reside within the court jurisdiction and must present copies of valid identity cards with verifiable addresses. The case was adjourned to January 24, 2022, for mention.
