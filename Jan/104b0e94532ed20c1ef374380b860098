 In commemoration of his 64th birthday, the immediate past Governor of Ogun State and the Senator representing Ogun Central and the National Assembly, Ibikunle Amosun, Friday, donated food stuffs and cash to correctional centers and special babies homes across the state capital. It has been the custom of the former governor to celebrate his birthday with aged people, inmates at correctional centers and motherless babies homes across the state. His 64th birthday was, again, not different and the Ibara Correctional Center in Abeokuta; Stella Obasanjo Motherless Children Home; Borstal Training Institute, Adigbe; and Daniel Akintonde School for Children with Special Needs, played hosts to the entourage of the former governor. Represented by his media aide, Bola Adeyemi, amongst others, Senator Amosun noted that the annual celebration of his  birthday in the midst of the needy in the society uplifts his hearts, stressing further that such goes a long way in giving a hope of a better tomorrow to the inmates. “It is good to be our neighbours’ keepers. Let us extend to other people whatever God has given to us, let us try and see how far we can help others,” Amosun stressed. Responding to the former governor’s gesture, Comptroller of the Nigerian Correctional Service, Ogun State Command, Abdul-Risheed Alimi, who expressed gratitude over the donation, stressed that the gesture would go a long way at scaling up the welfare of the inmates. “This will definitely give us a lot of leverage in terms of needs for inmates’ welfare. We will just continue to thank him and we pray that God will continue to give him all his heart desires.”
