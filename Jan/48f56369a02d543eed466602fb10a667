 Some clergies have assured Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State of their support in the upcoming 2023 general elections as soon as he makes public his intention. This is contained in a statement Bishop Jonathan Praise, convener of the Inter-denominational prayer in Abuja. “For this, over 100 Bishops and Christian clerics will hold a three-day prayer and fasting for Bello’s success in 2023. “The three-day prayer which will have clerics and over 1,000 church leaders drawn from each state of the federation will hold at the Unity Fountain in Abuja “The purpose of the gathering is to provide a spiritual shield and support for Gov. Bello, who is God’s anointed choice to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari. “Like the Biblical account of David, Gov. Bello is a man after God’s heart,” Praise said. Recalling how Bello rose to become governor, the Bishop said it was not mere coincidence but destiny. “He will shock critics at the next polls. In the Scriptures, there is no king who was the apple of God’s eye like David. “The heart of God has a special affection for the man who was later described by the Lord as, a man after my heart, who will do all my will. (Acts 13:33). “David was not perfect, he failed and sinned in many ways. So why did God love and bless him so much? Because God chose him. Yahaya Bello is our David and he embodies all his traits. “Like David, Bello is young, focused, dedicated, charismatic, passionate, compassionate, kind. Name it. He is a man that loves God,” Praise said. Praise therefore, called on Bello to formally declare his intention to run for President. NAN
