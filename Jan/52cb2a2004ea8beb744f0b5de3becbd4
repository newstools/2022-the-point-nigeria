 BY AKINWALE ABOLUWADE The residents of Barika and Agricola communities in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, were thrown into confusion, on Saturday, following the killing of a commercial motorcyclist in the area. Agricola Street, largely resided by students of the university, is near the UI 2nd Gate. It was learnt that the men of the underworld stormed the community around 8pm on Saturday, thereby throwing the residents into panic. One of the residents of Agricola, who identified himself simply as Gabriel, told journalists on Sunday that the robbers shot the okada rider at close range. He said that the okada rider was riding with a passenger when the hoodlums stopped him at the junction before the UI 2nd Gate and attempted to dispossess him of his motorcycle. Gabriel said, ”The okada rider did not want them to take away the motorcycle and as that was going on, the passenger jumped off and fled the scene. Sensing that the okada rider’s resistance might put them in danger, one of them brought out a gun and shot him on the head. ”The incident caused panic and many of the students and residents of the area could not sleep all through the night. ”Robbery is becoming rampant in the area now and government and security agencies should do something about it.” The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Adewale Osifeso, was unreachable at the time of filling this report.
