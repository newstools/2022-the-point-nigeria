Experts urge FG to tackle challenges hindering inflow of foreign capital into Nigeria In the last three years, beginning from 2019, inflow of capital from investors outside the shores of Nigeria has recorded a consistent drop and financial experts have said a lingering trend will further aggravate the problem of unemployment and development as the country is not able to raise enough revenue locally to drive growth. BAMIDELE FAMOOFO reports.  Nigeria, Africa’s largest economy, has witnessed a decelerating inflow of capital from foreign sources in the last three years and the trend, if sustained, would spell doom for the economy. Statistics made available by the National Bureau of Statistics analysed by The Point, showed that the level of drop recorded between the financial year 2019 and third quarter in 2021 stood at about 81%. Specifically, capital importation dropped to $4.52billion about N1.87trillion as at the third quarter in 2021 (the last quarter report still being awaited) compared with $23.99billion or N9.95trillion accrued from external sources in financial year 2019. Capital importation dropped by 59.7% in 2020 in the midst of the Coronavirus pandemic as inflow through all the sectors of the economy recorded significant drops. Total capital importation in 2020 dropped to $9.66billion about N4.01trillion down from about N9.95trillion recorded in the preceding financial year ended December 31, 2019. Further breakdown of the performance foreign capital inflow into Nigeria as at the third quarter ended September 30, 2021, showed that value declined by 53.2% from $9.66billion to $4.52billion (about N1.87trillion). By sector, capital importation into the most populous country in Africa was driven largely by the Banking sector and followed by Financing. The other three sectors on the top five chart include Shares (Equities), Production and Manufacturing. In the last three years, the banking sector attracted $12.87billion in foreign capital with the highest chunk of imports recorded in 2019 ($7.66billion). The sector has recorded a sustained decline since 2019 with capital importation decelerating to $3.75billion in 2020, representing a 51% drop. The trend persisted as at third quarter in 2021, though at a decreasing rate, as the sector recorded a 29.9% decline from $3.75billion to $1.46billion. The Financing sector which ranked number two on the table of top five capital importers into the country recorded a drop from $6.28billion in 2019 to about $784million as at third quarter in 2021. In three years, the sector was able to attract $8.96billion into the country. The capital market through trading of equities by foreign investors attracted $7.25billion to the country in three years (4th quarter 2021 figures excluded). The market emerged the third most valuable sector with respect to capital importation in the review period. However, capital inflow through the sector dropped by 74% in three years, from $4.3billion in 2019 to $1.1billion as at September 30, 2021. Capital importation through Shares recorded a decreasing decline between 2020 and 2021 at 40.5% from $1.85billion to $1.1billion. The Production and Servicing sectors ranked 4th and 5th respectively on the capital importation chart in three years with the former accounting for $2.97billion (about N1.23trillion) while the latter attracted $999.23million (about N414.47billion) in the same period. The Deputy Governor, Financial Systems Stability Directorate, CBN, Aishah Ahmad, acknowledged that all is not well with the nation’s productive sector as she pointed out that the manufacturing and non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers Indices for November 2021 remained below the 50 index points at 47.3 and 47.5 index points. PMI readings above 50.0 signal an improvement in business conditions, while readings below 50.0 show deterioration. Ahmad, who is also a member of the Monetary Policy Committee, said this in her personal statement at the last MPC meeting which was released by the CBN. She noted that data recently released by the NBS showed that domestic real GDP grew by 4.03 per cent year-on-year in the third quarter of 2021 compared with 5.01 and -3.62 per cent in Q2 2021 and Q3 2020, respectively. She noted that this marked the fourth consecutive positive output growth following the exit from recession in Q4 2020, adding that real GDP grew by 11.07 per cent in Q3 2021, compared with -0.79 per cent in the preceding quarter. Ahmad said, “The improvement in real GDP was driven mainly by growth in the non-oil sector by 5.44 per cent, reflecting the importance of ongoing CBN interventions and fiscal stimulus measures alongside efforts to further diversify the economic base and strengthen growth enhancing sectors. Q3 2021 performance review The total value of capital importation into Nigeria in the third quarter of 2021 stood at $1.731.37 million from $875.62 million in the preceding quarter of 2021 showing an increase of 97.73%. When compared to the corresponding quarter of 2020, capital importation as well increased by 18.47% from $1,461.49 million. The largest amount of capital importation by type was received through Portfolio investment, which accounted for 70.30% ($1,217.21 million) of total capital importation. This was followed by Other Investment which accounted for 23.47% ($406.35 million) and Foreign Direct Investment amounted to 6.23% ($107.81 million) of total capital imported in Q3 2021. By Sectors, capital importation into financing had the highest inflow of $469.17 million amounting to 27.10% of total capital imported in the third quarter of 2021.

Recommendations Financial experts from the Banking and Finance department of the Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka, in a recently published report on the effect of capital importation on Nigeria economic growth posited that the government must do more to tackle the various challenges hindering the inflow of foreign capital into the country. According to the study, insecurity in the country should be tackled by increasing funding on this sector, as worsening security challenges in the country serves as a deterrent to inflow of foreign capital in the country. Furthermore, the study recommended that Nigeria should ensure a stable government by guaranteeing the sustainability of democratic rule devoid of unwarranted changes and interference in the judiciary and legislative arm of government. “Nigeria should develop a code of conduct on multinational corporations to curb their restrictive business practises, limit their repatriation of profits from Nigeria and ensure that a significant part of their profits are reinvested into the Nigerian economy, “they further recommended. Meanwhile the experts acknowledged that desire for capital by developing countries as complement to domestic savings for growth and development has existed for many decades. “This is spurred by the gap between savings and investments required to sustain economic growth and evidenced by the attention given to the drive for foreign capital as an important source of augmenting the saving-investment gap in most resource deficient economies especially in developing countries.” But beyond improving on the conditions to attract foreign capital, the Chief Executive Officer, Financial Derivatives Company Limited, Bismarck Rewane, insisted that government agencies must do more locally to generate revenue as he noted that the country has largely depended on oil revenue to finance growth.  “There was a projected revenue of N7.99 trillion but we ended 2021 with N3.06 trillion and that is because our revenue is still largely oil dependent.” Rewane, while scoring Nigeria’s performance at 40 per cent in 2021, said the economy did not perform better in 2021 due to the failure of the nation’s Economic Recovery and Growth Plan. He said although Nigeria spent a lot last year, there was no much impact on its economy, adding that the money spent came from borrowings as well as taxes.
