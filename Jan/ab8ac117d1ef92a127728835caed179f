 The Ubudom Atta community in Njaba Local Government Area of Imo State are currently in shock following the killing of a 65-year-old man called Nnoruoka Onyeokwu by some yet-to-be-identified gunmen. The men of the underworld were reported to have beheaded the old man on Saturday, January 15, after which they staked his head at the primary school in the community. It was learnt that the community has been witnessing recurrent cases of violence and killings since last year. A community leader who spoke anonymously, on Monday, said that the victim was attacked in his house at night. The villagers said they were shocked to see his severed head dangling at the premises of the primary school in the village the next day. The community leader said, “The man was attacked at night in his house. People woke up the next morning to see his cut head being displayed at the primary school. “Nobody knew those who attacked him or why he was beheaded. The community is in a state of panic. People are running away because of the fear of the unknown. This is very unfortunate.” This came barely a month after the traditional ruler of the community, Edwin Azike, was kidnapped on December 8. His corpse was reported to have been dumped at the market square the next day.
