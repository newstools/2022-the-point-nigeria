 BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO A mother of four, Sofiat Gbadamosi, has attempted to commit suicide by jumping into the Osun River. It was gathered that the 30-year-old woman had been battling with an undisclosed health challenge and other personal issues that frustrated her and made her determined to take her own life. The attempt to take her own life was, however, foiled as those living in the neighbourhood alerted the police when they got wind of it. She was reportedly rescued by the policemen from the Ataoja Divisional Police Headquarters, Osogbo. A police officer, who was part of the rescue team, informed The Point that Gbadamosi went to the Osun River at Gbodofon, along Gbongan-Ibadan Expressway, Osogbo, to commit suicide. The police officer, who spoke anonymously, said that her life was saved as a result of the prompt intervention by the rescue team. “If not for the people passing by in the area, she would have drowned herself. She had already gotten into the river but we thank God that we were able to rescue her alive and unhurt. She has been taken to the station and we have calmed her down. “We discovered that she still needs attention and medical care. It’s after this that we can engage her further to know her personal troubles,” he said. The woman was incoherent while speaking with our correspondent. She said that she had been having a series of problems, both personal and health issues. She explained that with failed attempts to surmount her challenges, she gave up on life. The woman, who spoke in Yoruba language, said, “After I took my kids to school, I trekked to the Osun River to end it all. It wasn’t intentional because I was even praying to God to send helpers to me and that I should not be tied down with chains. I had prayed tirelessly about the issues affecting my life but no solutions yet.” Police authorities said that they were trying to locate the woman’s husband with a view to reuniting her with her family for proper care.
