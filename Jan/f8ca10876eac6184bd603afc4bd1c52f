… threaten nationwide protest  BY FOLASHADE KEHINDE THE All Progressives Congress Youth Development and Solidarity Forum (APC-YDSF) has called on all governors elected on the platform of APC to sack the Director-General of the Progressive Governors Forum, Salihu Moh Lukman, with immediate effect. The group said APC stakeholders were ready to stage a massive nationwide protest if Salihu continued as DG, PGF. According to them, Lukman has proved that he is an agent of a few selfish interests in the party and that of the opposition People Democratic Party. Their decision came on the heels of an open letter authored recently by the DG and sent to party leaders, which he reportedly promoted in the media to achieve his alleged objective of destabilising the APC. The group said this in a statement signed by its Secretary-General, Hon. Tobias Ogbeh, noting that what Lukman had done was to practically provide reference materials for a contrived PDP win in the 2023 general elections. It stated, “We find it most unfortunate that the DG decided to exploit the timing of our great party’s National Convention to ply his poisonous ware by pretending to make a legitimate intervention. “It is ironic that Lukman was unable to conceal the agenda he has for truncating the successes recorded by the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), which even him admitted has done a great job in stabilizing the APC. “As our Forum struggles to come to terms with the reality that the man who administers the umbrella body of APC governors is a mole within the party and being used by some forces to destroy our organization from inside, we find it pertinent to alert stakeholders to the dangers that the DG’s continued occupation of that office poses to the success of the APC in the months ahead.”
