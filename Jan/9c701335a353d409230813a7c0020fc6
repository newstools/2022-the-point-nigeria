 BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO Osun State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, has condoled with Governor Seyi Makinde and the people of Oyo State over the passage of the Olubadan of Ibadan, Oba Saliu Adetunji, who transited on Sunday morning. Oyetola, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Ismail Omipidan, on Sunday, also extended his condolences to the royal family, the Olubadan-in-Council, and the people of Ibadan. The statement read that the demise of the first class traditional ruler, which came on the heels of the passage of Soun of Ogbomoso, was another colossal loss to Yorubaland. It stated that Olubadan’s exit left a void that would be difficult to fill. It described the late monarch as a respected royal father, exemplary and compassionate leader who showed strong concern and commitment to the welfare of his subjects and the development of Ibadan within the short period of his reign. “On behalf of the government and people of Osun, I commiserate with Governor Seyi Makinde, government and people of Oyo State over the transition of the Olubadan of Ibadan, Oba Saliu Adetunji. I also condole the royal family, Olubadan-in-Council and all Ibadan indigenes at home and abroad as well as the Oyo State Traditional Council. “The late Oba Saliu Akanmu was a respected royal father, exemplary and compassionate leader who demonstrated strong concern and commitment to the welfare of his subjects and the development of Ibadan within the short period of his reign. He will be remembered for his fatherly roles and wise counsel,” the statement read in parts.
