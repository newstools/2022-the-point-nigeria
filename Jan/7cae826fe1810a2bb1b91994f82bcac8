 Police in Zamfara State have rescued 21 children, including two females who were kidnapped on their way to an Almajiri school in Katsina. Mohammed Shehu, the Command’s Police Public Relations Officer, in a statement, explained that the abducted children were from Rini village in Bakura Local Government Area of Zamfara State. BBC Hausa had earlier reported that the security agents got the information that the bandits had laid siege to travelers along the Gusau Funtua Road, at the Kucheri axis. Scores of travellers in five vehicles were reportedly held hostage. It was gathered that the security agents moved to the place and engaged the bandits in a fierce gun duel. The Zamfara State Police Command appealed to drivers and passengers to avoid night journey, saying that the bandits attack mostly at night.
