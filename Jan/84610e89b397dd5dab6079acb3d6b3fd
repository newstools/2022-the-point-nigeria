 BY AKINWALE ABOLUWADE, IBADAN There is a need for governments at all levels to boost investment in security, create enabling culture and develop public utilities for economic growth and development, Damola Are, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Kakanfo Inn and Conference, has stated. Are spoke to The Point in an exclusive interview at the weekend at the precinct of the New Year Party and award ceremony for staff of the four-star hotel, held at the Lekan Are Hall. In view of the harsh and un-conducive business environment in the country, he suggested that the leadership should ensure that urgent steps were taken to encourage investments. He said, “The government should create an enabling culture. There should be quality facilities in place, there should be a modern transportation system and adequate security to key destinations. “Government should create more tax shelters for hospitality companies to spur growth which, in turn, will benefit the overall economy.” More than a dozen outstanding staff of the Kakanfo Inn and Conference Centre were rewarded with cash gifts and awards of excellence at the New Year Party. Are said that the objective of the event was to “appreciate and recognize last year’s top performers and motivate the entire team forward as we go into 2022. “My advice for them is to create a solid and memorable customer experience, exhibit integrity and always maintain a positive character.” Among the recipients of the awards were Deji Aboderin, Head of Club XS; Bukola Odafe-Fakeye, Human Resources Manager; and Nkwoye Kelachukwu, who won the most valuable transport and security team member 2021. Other winners were Sola Makinde, Owolabi Adegoke, Felix Umoren, Ayomide Afolabi, Ndem Onyebuchi, Haruna Sunday, Dennis Williams and Marvelous Adadu, who won the most versatile team member for 2021.
