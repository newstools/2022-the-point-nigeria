 The Managing Director of Wema Bank Plc, Ademola Adebise, has described the Serving Overseer of Citadel Global Community Church, Pastor Tunde Bakare, as one of the customers that have maintained credible relationship with the bank and that there was no basis to humiliate him as been speculated. Adebise spoke on Friday during a Court Ordered Meeting & Extraordinary General meeting of the bank to clarify the issue of N9 billion loan facilities to Bakare to build CGCC. The Managing Director, who described Bakare as the main promoter of the bank was reacting to the enquiries by a customer, Tunde Badmus, who said the bank should let the public know that it’s not in its tradition to call out its customers. He, however, counseled that Wema Bank is a corporate organization and should not be drawn to any political vendetta by politicians. He said, “I would want to address the recent news in the public space regarding our customer and in particular the main promoter Pastor Tunde Bakare. “While we are constrained by the reason of confidentiality to respond in details to this publication, we however want to confirm that the customer has maintained a credible relationship with our bank and there is no basis for us to contemplate any action to humiliate our customer. “Furthermore, we will like to reassure our shareholders and customers that the bank has and will continue to operate with the highest level of corporate governance, following all rules, policies and procedures.”
