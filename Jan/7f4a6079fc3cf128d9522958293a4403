 Former Governor of Ogun State and Senator representing Ogun Central Senatorial District, Ibikunle Amosun, has commiserated with the Alao-Akala family of Ogbomoso, the government and people of Oyo State, on the passage of Christopher Adebayo Alao-Akala, former Governor of Oyo State. Alao-Akala died on Wednesday, January 12, 2022 at the age of 71 years. In his condolence message, Amosun, in a statement issued by his media aide, Bola Adeyemi, paid a glowing tribute to Alao-Akala’s service to the government and people of Oyo State, as a Local Government Chairman, Deputy Governor, and later as Governor of the State. “His contributions to the development of Oyo State will continue to resonate in the annals of the State,” Amosun added. According to Amosun, “Beyond governance and politics, Otunba Christopher Adebayo Akala also made remarkable impact in his career, as a Police Officer, where he rose through the ranks to retire as an Assistant Commissioner of Police in charge of Logistics and Supply, Oyo State.” Amosun prayed that Almighty God will grant him eternal rest, and give his immediate and political family, as well as the entire people of Oyo State, the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss.
