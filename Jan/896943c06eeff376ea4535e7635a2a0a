 BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO An 18-year-old boy, Dele Omodiji, and a woman called Rukayat Ogunlowo, have been arrested by men of the Osun State Police Command for allegedly stealing 2,100 pieces of fish from a pond. The suspects, said to be workers at Oris Farm in Osogbo, were accused of evacuating the fish from a pond in the farm. The farm owner, Opebiyi Oluwole, claimed that the two workers sold the fish after leaving the pond in their care. After investigation, the police arraigned Omodiji and Ogunlowo before an Osogbo Magistrate Court over allegation of stealing the fish.
 Police prosecutor, Inspector Bose Shoyemi, informed the court that the duo conspired to commit the act on December 10, 2021 at Oris Farm, behind Mallam Tope area, Osogbo. Shoyemi said that the stolen fish were valued at N2, 730,000. The charge reads that “Omodiji and Ogunlowo, on the same date and place, did steal 2,100 fish in a fish pond belonging to one Opebiyi Oluwole valued at N2,730,000,00.” The prosecutor said that the offences contravened sections 516 and 383 and punishable under Section 390(9) of the Criminal Code, Cap 34, Volume II Laws of Osun State, 2002. The prosecutor however told the court that the complainant had written to withdraw the case for out of court settlement. Magistrate A. A. Adeyeba said that the matter would no longer be entertained if the out of court settlement failed to yield the desired result. Adeyeba, therefore, struck out the matter.
