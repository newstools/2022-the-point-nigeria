 BY AKINWALE ABOLUWADE, IBADAN The delay in the approval of the nomination of the Otun Olubadan, Senator Lekan Balogun, as the next Olubadan of Ibadanland by Governor Seyi Makinde may soon be over following the decision by the High Chiefs to withdraw the pending litigation against their obaship status. The decision was taken at the meeting of members of the Olubadan-in-Council held at the Oja’ba Palace of the Olubadan, on Tuesday. The Otun-Balogun of Ibadanland, High Chief Tajudeen Ajibola, who spoke with our reporter after the closed door meeting which lasted about two hours, said that the High Chiefs concurred with the governor’s call for the withdrawal of the suit. He stated that the process of withdrawing the case had commenced, stressing that due process would be followed. “The case was adjourned to the 1st day of February, and whatever happens, we would have to get to court before the withdrawal can take place.” Recall that the members of the Olubadan-in-Council met with the state governor, last Saturday, over the issue of succession to the Olubadan throne which became vacant following the demise of Oba Saliu Adetunji, on January 2. At the meeting, it was gathered that the court case was the main issue delaying government’s pronouncement of the next Olubadan as proposed by the Ibadan Kingmakers at their last week meeting.
