 Commissioner for Health and Human Services in Benue State, Dr Joseph Ngbea, has confirmed two cases of Lassa Fever in the state. Ngbea disclosed this in a telephone interview with journalists in the state in Makurdi, on Monday. The commissioner said that one of the victims died in Edo State as he was referred to Irrewa Specialist Hospital for treatment, stressing that the other one was not in a critical condition. “Anybody who contacts the disease should be taken to the Benue State University Teaching Hospital within 20 minutes. “So, people should stop the idea of keeping food outside and on the ground. Also, people should be discouraged from eating rats. “People should keep away anything that would encourage rats to enter their homes. “Those are the preventive measures. Apart from that, people should also see their doctors if they have fever,” Ngbea said. He said that the ministry would organise a workshop on Lassa Fever in the state to create more awareness. (NAN).
