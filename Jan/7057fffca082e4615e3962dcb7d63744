 The first Africa Cup of Nations to be played in Cameroon since 1972 begins Sunday when the hosts begin Group A play against Burkina Faso at 11am ET. A tournament ripe with Premier League players and prospects holds sway over an entire continent for nearly a month until the final is staged February 6, and we’ve got your schedule and standings here. There has not been a repeat winner or finalist at AFCON since Egypt won at home in 2006 before claiming the 2008 tournament title in Ghana and the 2010 edition in Angola, with Algeria and Senegal holding hopes of bucking that trend in February. Algeria beat Senegal 1-0 in 2019 to triumph in Egypt and become the seventh nation to win multiple AFCONs, following Democratic Republic of Congo (1968, 1974), Ivory Coast (1992, 2015), Nigeria (1980, 1994, 2013), Ghana (1963, 1965, 1978, 1982), Cameroon (1984, 1988, 2000, 2002, 2017), and Egypt (1957, 1959, 1986, 1998, 2006, 2008, 2010). Below you’ll find the tables, schedules, how to watch info, and outright odds for the winner of AFCON. 2021 Africa Cup of Nations group tables Group A Burkina Faso Cape Verde Cameroon Ethiopia Group B Guinea Malawi Senegal Zimbabwe Group C Comoros Gabon Ghana Morocco Group D Egypt Guinea-Bissau Nigeria Sudan Group E Algeria Ivory Coast Equatorial Guinea Sierra Leone Group F Gambia Mali Mauritania Tunisia How to watch Africa Cup of Nations in USA Kickoff dates: January 9 – February 6 Location: Cameroon TV Channel: BeIn Sports (select games) Stream: BeIn Sports Xtra 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (in 2022) schedule Sunday, January 9 Cameroon vs Burkina Faso, 11am ET Ethiopia vs Cape Verde, 3pm ET Monday, January 10 Senegal vs Zimbabwe, 8am ET Morocco vs Ghana, 11am ET Guinea vs Malawi, 11am ET Comoros vs Gabon, 2pm ET Tuesday, January 11 Algeria vs Sierra Leone, 8am ET Nigeria vs Egypt, 11am ET Sudan vs Guinea-Bissau, 2pm ET Wednesday, January 12 Tunisia vs Mali, 8am ET Mauritania vs Gambia, 11am ET Equatorial Guinea vs Ivory Coast, 2pm ET Thursday, January 13 Cameroon vs Ethiopia, 11am ET Cape Verde vs Burkina Faso, 2pm ET Friday, January 14 Senegal vs Guinea, 8am ET Morocco vs Comoros, 11am ET Malawi vs Zimbabwe, 11am ET Gabon vs Ghana, 2pm ET Saturday, January 15 Nigeria vs Sudan, 11am ET Guinea-Bissau vs Egypt, 2pm ET Sunday, January 16 Gambia vs Mali, 8am ET Tunisia vs Mauritania, 11am ET Ivory Coast vs Sierra Leone, 11am ET Algeria vs Equatorial Guinea, 2pm ET Monday, January 17 Cape Verde vs Cameroon, 11am ET Burkina Faso vs Ethiopia, 11am ET Tuesday, January 18 Malawi vs Senegal, 11am ET Zimbabwe vs Guinea, 11am ET Gabon vs Morocco, 2pm ET Ghana vs Comoros, 2pm ET Wednesday, January 19 Egypt vs Sudan, 2pm ET Guinea-Bissau vs Nigeria, 2pm ET Thursday, January 20 Ivory Coast vs Algeria, 11am ET Sierra Leone vs Equatorial Guinea, 11am ET Gambia vs Tunisia, 2pm ET Mali vs Mauritania, 2pm ET Sunday, January 23 – Wednesday, January 26 —- Round of 16 Saturday, January 29 – Sunday, January 30 —- Quarterfinals Wednesday, February 2 – Thursday, February 3—- Semifinals Sunday, February 6 — Third-place game and Final NBCSports.com
