 Officials of the Nigeria Security and Defence Corps, Osun State Command, have confirmed the arrest of a woman called Zainab Azeez for allegedly pouring hot water on her 11 year-old-daughter. Report has it that the woman had the girl in her first marriage in Lagos State before relocating to Osogbo with the girl. The woman, a resident of Shittu Street, Oke-Oniti, Osogbo, was said to have attacked her daughter on Saturday, January 15, for refusing to run an errand for her. An eyewitness, Adeola Lolade, said that “Zainab is found of abusing the girl over the years. Her neighbours had talked to her in the past with the way she treats the daughter. Even if her husband tried to intervene, she would hurl insult on him and sometimes harass him. “She just bathed her daughter with hot water, not just because the girl refused to run an errand for her but she had been beating the girl. There are scars on the girl’s body. “Anytime she feels like beating her, she would allege her of an offence, warning that she must not shout and she would shut the door. “Sometime in May or June last year, she was arrested by the police after a complaint by her neighbours after she hit the girl with a stick on her head. She intimidated the girl to the point that she could not speak out. “On the day that she poured hot water on the girl, she alleged the her of misplacing a key which was later found. She vowed to beat her. A few minutes later, she instructed her to go and grind pepper but the girl refused thinking that it was a subtle way to get her. “She angrily poured hot water on the girl. While the girl wriggled in pain, she abandoned her to her fate. This angered one of her neighbours who entered her house, dragged her out and fought her while other neighbours took the injured girl to the clinic for treatment.” The Public Relations Officer of NSCDC, Daniel Adigun, said that the woman and her daughter
were both in their custody as investigation was ongoing on the matter.
