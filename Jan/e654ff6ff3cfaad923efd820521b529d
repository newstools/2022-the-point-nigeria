 A fire that ripped through South Africa’s parliament building over the weekend has been brought under control, the fire service said on Tuesday. The fire outbreak, which started on Sunday, was aggravated by strong wind that fanned the flames thereby worsening the situation on Monday evening. It was extinguished after midnight, fire service spokesman, Jermaine Carelse, told broadcaster eNCA. Meanwhile, it was gathered that a 49-year-old man who was arrested inside the building would appear before a magistrate today (Tuesday). The man was said to have been charged with burglary, arson and theft. The National Assembly chamber and many offices within the building were destroyed by the fire. The cost of rebuilding the historic structure was put at several millions of dollars. (dpa/NAN).
