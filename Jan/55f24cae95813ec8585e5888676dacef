 Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo, SAN, has reportedly cautioned his supporters against insulting the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, as the scramble for the party’s presidential ticket thickens. Recall that Osinbajo served as the Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice during Tinubu’s administration as governor in Lagos State. Their supporters continued to biker as the duo eyed the APC 2023 presidential ticket with some supporters of Tinubu accusing Osinbajo of being an ingrate for not supporting the presidential aspiration of his former principal. One of the close associates of Osinbajo was quoted as saying that the VP was against those casting aspersion on Tinubu. He said that the VP had warned his supporters, stating that “Even if his supporters abuse my mother, don’t retaliate. On no account must he be insulted or denigrated.” While Osinbajo allegedly enjoys the support of some northern emirs based on his perceived uncommon loyalty to President Muhammadu Buhari, Tinubu is said to be more popular in the north.
