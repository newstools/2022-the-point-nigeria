 BY ANDREW EKEJIUBA Arrangements are in top gear towards the successful hosting of the maiden edition of Inter Bankers Games scheduled to hold between February and March, 2022. Chairman of Chartered Institute of Bankers, Kano State Chapter, Aliyu Wada Nas, stated this while shedding light on the proposed games. Nas explained that based on the demands from various banks across the state, there was an urgent need to expand the competition to six more other games, aside from football. The chairman pointed out that so far the organisers have been working round the clock to ensure the success of the games. Nas said the games expected to be competed include tennis, table tennis, badminton, squash and basketball among others. He said all games would be played at Bayero University Kano (old and new sites) facilities, and expressed gratitude to the university’s Vice Chancellor, Sagir Adamu Abbas, for approving the usage of its facilities for the games. The chairman then appealed to the participating teams to give the organisers all maximum support and cooperation towards hitch free games. On the sponsorship drive, he added that efforts have been intensified to scout for sponsors in order to actualize its set objectives. The Inter Bankers soccer competition has been organised for over one decade in Kano State and organisers decided to expand it to other events.
