 Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State, on Wednesday, directed that flags in the state should be flown at half-mast in honour of former governor of the state, Chief Adebayo Alao-Akala. The governor gave the directive on his Instagram page shortly after the 2022 Inter-faith Prayer Service was brought to a close. The prayer service, organised by the Oyo State Civil Service, came to an abrupt end on Wednesday following the report of Alao-Akala’s death. During the inter-faith service, Makinde called for a minute silence in honour of the former governor who also served as deputy governor of the state between 2003 and 2007. The governor prayed God to grant repose to the soul of his predecessor in office. A statement by Taiwo Adisa, Chief Press Secretary to Governor Makinde indicated that the latter did not read the speech that was prepared for the annual inter-faith service held to mark the commencement of the New Year. Makinde condoled with the immediate family members of the former governor, his political associates and the residents of the state. “I am here with the speech prepared for this event but I have just been informed about the death of former governor of the state, Otunba Adebayo-Akala. “I pray that God grants his loved ones and all his well-wishers the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss.” On his Instagram page he wrote, “I join the good people of Oyo State to mourn the passing of a former governor of our dear state, Otunba Christopher Adebayo Alao-Akala, which sad event took place today. May his soul rest in peace and may God grant his family the fortitude to bear this great loss. “I have directed that flags fly at half-mast in honour of (former) governor Alao-Akala, our brother, friend and illustrious son of Oyo State. “His Excellency will be remembered for his contributions to the development of Oyo State as governor, especially for taking infrastructural development to other zones of the state outside Ibadan.”
