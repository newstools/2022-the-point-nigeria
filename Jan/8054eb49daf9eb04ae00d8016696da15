 The Ogun State Police Command has disowned a purported compiled list of suspected internet fraudsters, popularly known as Yahoo boys, circulating on social media and alleged to have emanated from its command. The Police Public Relations Officer, Deputy Superintendent of Police, Abimbola Oyeyemi, said in a statement on Sunday that the command would have ignored the said list, but for the fact that some extortionists may use it as an opportunity to turn those on the list to easy prey, hence the need to alert the public that the list did not emanate from the command. According to Oyeyemi, the command has no Assistant Commissioner of Police with the name Yahaya Wakilu who signed the said list. “It is also worthy of note that no Assistant Commissioner of Police serving under a Deputy Commissioner of Police will use a red pen to sign any document. “Also, the phone number on the fake police letterhead used to compile the list is that of a retired Commissioner of Police, who was a one-time, the DC Operations in the Command. “The command hereby appeals to members of the public to disregard the said list as the command has nothing to do with it, it is nothing but fake news,” he said.
