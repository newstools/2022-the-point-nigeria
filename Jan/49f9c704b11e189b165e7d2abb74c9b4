 BY BAMIDELE FAMOOFO The Monetary Policy Committee at the end of its first meeting held in Abuja today has retained Monetary Policy Rate at 11.5%. This is in line with expectations of financial experts that the MPC may likely maintain a status quo. Cash Reserve Ratio was retained at 27.5% while Liquidity Ratio remained at 30%. Godwin Emefiele, Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria mentioned during a press briefing monitored online by The Point that the decision of the MPC to retain all monetary policy parameters the same way they are was because the policy is working for the economy. He dismissed fears that inflation will go out of hands with the MPC’s refusal to tighten lending by raising interest rate as he explained that lending is being technically controlled with CRR at 27.5%. Emefiele disclosed that inflation which rose in December after a consecutive eight months deceleration may trend downwards again going by the level of farms harvest achieved in the 2021 planting season. Referring to the recent rice pyramid displayed in Abuja by the Rice Farmers’ Association of Nigeria, the CBN boss said the volume of harvest achieved in rice paddy in the 2021 season could not be quantified with what was displayed in the pyramid. He said the CBN in collaboration with banks and other financial institutions will continue to reflate the economy by making funding available for developmental projects.
