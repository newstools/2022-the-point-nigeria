 Ubermoto, the latest ride-hailing app by Uber, has launched in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital. UberMoto is a two-wheeler low-cost alternative and smart mobility option for city residents. The company expressed the hope that it would help riders in Ibadan to navigate traffic quicker and effectively from one place to another. According to the company, the innovation, which has a minimum fare of about NGN100, is part of its expansion plan on its product offering, UberX, introduced in Ibadan in 2021. The Country Manager, Uber Nigeria, Tope Akinwumi, said, “As we recover, we know we need to continue to offer solutions that respond to consumers who are looking for smart mobility solutions while providing new revenue streams and earning opportunities for drivers. “UberMoto extends on current product offerings already available in the city with safety, reliability, and convenience. Just a tap away, residents of Ibadan are now able to travel around the city by requesting the well-trusted motorcycles which are now available on the Uber app. “It makes sense for us to launch a product that will help passengers get to their destination quicker, which is where we can leverage our technology and we are excited to introduce UberMoto to make this a reality.” He added that UberMoto carried the same door-to-door safety features as any other Uber option such as Injury Protection, 24/7 support, including driver background checks and screenings. To request a trip on UberMoto, riders need to simply open the app and tap on UberMoto. They can then select cash or card as their payment option. Ubermoto is designed in a way that riders would see whether others have had a good experience with the UberMoto drivers and would be able to contact each other via the app if there is any confusion around pick-up details.
