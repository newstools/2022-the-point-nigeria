 Popular Juju maestro, Dayo Kujore, has been confirmed dead. He was said to have died at age 63. Late Kujore, the ‘Soko Extra’ crooner, was one of the pioneers of the juju musical art. His daughter said that he died on Monday. Circumstances surrounding his death have yet to be revealed. A formal announcement is expected to be made by the family. The late musician was born on April 4, 1958 in Igbore Robiyan, Abeokuta, Ogun State to parents who were clerics of the African Church. During his early days, Kujore joined the choir in his local church and learnt how to play musical instruments such as the guitar, and the piano which made him fall in love with music. Some Juju musicians who came to his village to perform at special events reportedly spotted the young Kujore and invited him to join their band. He performed with the likes of Chief Composer, Jossy Olu Oguntade, MD Jaiyesinmi and Prince Adekunle. He later formed the Superstars band with some youths. Once asked if he had a misunderstanding with Sir Shina Peters, he was quoted as saying, “I have never fought with Shina Peters. When we read the news that we were fighting, we laughed over it together.”
