 Kenyan police said, on Tuesday, that five suspects were arrested in connection with the killing of seven civilians in the coastal region of Lamu County on Monday. The National Police Service Spokesperson, Bruno Shioso, said the suspects were nabbed on Tuesday over the attack at Widhu Majembeni and Bobo-Sunkia – both in Lamu. Shioso said that the Police saw seven people killed in separate incidents on Monday, adding that the suspects were being interrogated over the terror attack linked to land disputes. He further stated that the investigating team was following leads in a bid to establish whether the attack was connected with the outlawed al-Shabab or their sympathisers operating in the area. “All the suspects are locals and we are talking to them to establish more about the attack,’’ he said in a brief statement. Lamu County has been in the spotlight for some years now, owing to increased attacks by the militants that left hordes of security officers and civilians dead. (Xinhua/NAN).
