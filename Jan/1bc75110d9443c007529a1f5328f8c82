 A report from the World Bank estimated that global losses due to the Covid-19 pandemic will be close to $13.8trillion in 2024. “These numbers would have been much worse had it not been for the extraordinary work of scientists, of the medical community, and the swift and aggressive policy responses across the world,” the Bank said. The World Bank disclosed that at the start of the third year of the pandemic, the global death toll has risen to 5.5 million deaths. The Bank in the report said much work remains to ensure the losses are contained and to reduce wide disparities in recovery prospects across countries. “Policy initiatives are needed to reverse the large learning losses suffered by children, especially in developing countries. On average, students in middle-income and low-income countries had 93 more days of nation-wide school closures than those in high income countries. On climate, a bigger push is needed to get to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, with carbon pricing mechanisms, green infrastructure investment, research subsidies, and financing initiatives so that all countries can invest in climate change mitigation and adaptation measures.” It urged policymakers to vigilantly monitor a broad swath of incoming economic data, prepare for contingencies, and be ready to communicate and execute policy changes at short notice. In parallel, bold, and effective international cooperation should ensure that this is the year the world escapes the grip of the pandemic.
