 A bomb planted on a motorbike went off in a busy shopping district in the eastern Pakistani city of Lahore, on Thursday, killing three people and wounding scores more, officials said. Bombing in the metropolis of more than 10 million people was a rarity, but the Thursday incident occurred amid a surge in attacks by the Pakistani Taliban. The Taliban allegedly operated from hideouts in neighbouring Afghanistan. There was a child among the dead and, at least, 26 injured people were taken to hospitals, local administration chief, Mohamed Usman Younis, said. Police officer, Abid Khan, explained that investigation showed that the motorbike on which the bomb was planted, was parked outside a shop. At least, four of the injured were in critical condition, said Iftikhar Ahmed, a doctor at the city’s main hospital. The violence by the Pakistani Taliban, a separate group from their Afghan counterparts, has surged in recent weeks. Pakistani Taliban, waging an insurgency to implement sharia rule in that country, just as their counterparts did in Afghanistan, stepped up attacks after the fall of Kabul. Pakistan’s government, on Wednesday, raised the security alert across major cities after the Taliban launched more than a dozen attacks this week. (dpa/NAN).
