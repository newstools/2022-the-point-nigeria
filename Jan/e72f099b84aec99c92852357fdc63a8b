He was said to have taken a bow in the light of the crisis trailing the February National Convention of the ruling All Progressives Congress. Following the Sunday night meeting of the APC Governors’ Forum, some governors were said to have called for his exit from the position for being too forward. However, report had it that some of the governors were against the demand for his removal, saying that he should be allowed to continue to speak in his personal capacity as a chieftain of the party. Lukman has yet to respond to the development. A party official was quoter as saying that “The PGF boss has done the right thing by acting according to his conscience.”
