 Tricycle operators in Kano have suspended their three-day strike effective from today (Thursday). The transporters embarked on strike in protest against the newly introduced operational permit by the Kano State Road and Traffic Agency. The decision to call off the strike was taken at a meeting held on Wednesday between the Managing Director of KAROTA, Baffa Babba-Dan’agundi, who represented the state government, and the leadership of the tricycle operators in the state. The meeting was held at the state headquarters of the Nigerian Bar Association in Kano, and moderated by Mahmoud Gadanya, a lawyer. The lawyer, who stood in for the transporters, Abba Hikima, announced the suspension of the strike while addressing journalists shortly after the meeting. Hikima said that among other resolutions, it was agreed at the meeting that members of the association would resume operations from Thursday. He stated that the association would write to the state government to request for the reduction of the operational permit from N8,000. Hikima revealed that no tricycle operator would be forced to continue to pay the amount until the state government stated its position on the fee which would be announced at a meeting to be reconvened on or before January 18. He added that members of the association would also continue to pay the daily levy of N100, among other resolutions. (NAN).
