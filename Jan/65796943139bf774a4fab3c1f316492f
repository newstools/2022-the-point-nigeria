 AGNES NWORIE, ABAKALIKI Governor David Umahi of Ebonyi State has said that his government would complete the ongoing construction of the international cargo airport and other ongoing projects before the end of the year. Umahi made the promise in his new year message to the residents of the state, on Saturday, saying that “It is, indeed, an honour to witness the first day of the year 2022 in good health and peace. This can only be made possible by the Omnipotent maker of the universe and to him alone be the glory. We have to be very grateful. “2021 was a rewarding year for Nigerians, Ebonyians not excluded, despite pockets of skirmishes that initially threatened to shake the foundation of what binds us together but we thank God Almighty for finally bringing the year to a perfect end. For us in government, 2022 is a very promising year and very significant in the political annals of the history of our young Ebonyi State. “It is our earnest expectation to conclude all ongoing projects, including the ongoing construction of the International Airport, the King David University of Medical Sciences Uburu, the Olympic Stadium, as well as other critical projects before the end of this year to place the state on irreversible gear for all-round development. In doing so, we beseech you to go about your legitimate businesses and support the government in whichever way possible, including doable sacrifices to lay enduring legacies. “In the end, all of us would be glad for being part of the success story of the modern Ebonyi State. On behalf of my family, government, and the good people of Ebonyi State, I pray and declare that we all shall see the end of 2022, and 2022 will not see our end in Jesus’ name, amen.”
