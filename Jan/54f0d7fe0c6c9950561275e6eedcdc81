 BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO Ahead of the July 16, 2022 governorship poll in Osun State, the leadership of the African Church in the state, on Thursday, expressed their readiness to mobilise their members for the re-election of Governor Adegboyega Oyetola. The Church said that “On no account would the Osun people allow the state to be governed by charlatans.” It applauded the achievements of the present administration in the state in the last three years. The Bishop of African Church, Christ Cathedral, Ife Diocese, Rev. Michael Adeyemi, during the Annual 2022 Prayer Summit held at the Banquet Hall, Government House, Osogbo, applauded Governor Oyetola, saying that his antecedent would earn him a second term. Adeyemi, who stated that Osun State was too sophisticated to be governed by a novice, said that no effort would be spared to have a credible personality as governor. He said, “Your Excellency, I am standing here today for and on behalf of The African Church in Osun State to appreciate you sincerely, to pledge our sincere loyalty to you and to express our support for you and your government. “We are not here today as a political group. To the glory of God, we are here as a responsible religious organization. We are here not to play politics but to let you know that as a church of God, we are watching you closely. “In Osun State today, I am bold to tell you that people are rejoicing because you are in authority and because you are a righteous man. This state is known as Ipinle Omoluabi and whoever will be governing the state must also be an Omoluabi. “As far as we are concerned in The African Church in Osun State, we will work for your second term. We shall encourage our members to ensure you are returned to continue your good works.”
