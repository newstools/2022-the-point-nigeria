BY FOLASHADE KEHINDE THERE was confusion on Thursday when Nollywood actress, Sidikat Odukanwi, who was earlier pronounced dead, reportedly came back to life. The death of Odukanwi, 62, popularly called Iyabo Oko, had first been announced on Instagram by her daughter, Bisi Aisha. But Bisi gave updates three hours after that her mother had moved her hand and had come back alive. “My mum is gone. Rest well mummy. May ur soul Rest In Peace mummy,” she had earlier posted. She updated the post on Thursday, saying, “Wonderful being, she moved her hand after being confirmed dead three hours ago. God, we will forever praise your holy name.” Foluke Daramola-Salako, who had also earlier announced Iyabo Oko’s death, updated her post, saying, “Just heard from her daughter again that she moved her hand and she is still alive. Hallelujah! She is alive.”
