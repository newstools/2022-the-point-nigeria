 BY FOLASHADE KEHINDE THE Serving Overseer of the Citadel Global Community Church, Tunde Bakare, is set to unveil his ‘Project 16’ as the country looks forward to events that will produce the next President of Nigeria. Though Bakare, outspoken and fearless pastor, had frequently spoken about being No. 16, referring to the order of presidents in Nigeria, the event, slated for January 19, is more about Nigeria, not an individual, according to reports. President Muhammadu Buhari is the 15th President of Nigeria, hence the catchphrase Project 16. On the forthcoming event, Bakare who was Buhari’s running mate under the Congress for Progressive Change in 2011, told his Church, I’m inviting you to GAIN Network. You must be there, whether you are network member or not. For the first day, I’m opening before the whole world: PROJECT 16. “Because you don’t know what it means. You think it’s seeking power. You think it’s becoming this or becoming that. I need to open it to you what it is all about. It will be done in the open, not in secret; so that there will be clarity for everyone.”
