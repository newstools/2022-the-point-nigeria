 The Coalition of the All Progressives Congress Youth Groups, on Sunday, passed a vote of confidence in Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State as the leader of the party’s Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee. The leader of the group, Malam Bashar Binji, said at a news conference in Abuja that Buni remained the chairman of the committee in spite of odds. “We call on youths and other members of the party to disregard fake news and all attempts and ploys to destabilise the party and the successes it has recorded so far. “No well-meaning party member will condone any distraction at a time when the Buni-led CECPC has done so much in repositioning the party in line with the guidance of President Muhammadu Buhari,’’ Binji said. He enjoined party members not to lose sight of the productive leadership that Governor Buni gave to the CECPC and the party as a whole. “Since being in the saddle, Governor Buni has continued to increase the fortunes of the party,’’ Binji stressed. He stressed that Buni, alongside other members, were able to bring top ranking politicians and governors into the APC. These, he said, included Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River State; Governor Bello Matawalle of Zamfara; Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi; former Ogun State governor, Gbenga Daniel; Chief Jimoh Ibrahim, and Stella Oduah, among others. He stressed, “As we approach a very crucial transition year 2023, we must invest more in efforts that can promote unity and peace.’’ (NAN).
