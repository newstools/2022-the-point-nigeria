 BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO The factional candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in the July 16 governorship election in Osun State, Dotun Babayemi, has disclosed that efforts were on course to reconcile aggrieved interests in the party. He said a workable mechanism to reconcile aggrieved interests within the fold of the major opposition party was being evolved by elders and stakeholders of the party. Babayemi gave the assurance in a statement issued by his Media Office in Osogbo on Tuesday. He pointed out that reconciliation was one of the surest ways of guaranteeing the success of the party before, during and after the election in three months’ time. “As the party torchbearer in the state, I promise not to leave any stone unturned and any concerned quarter untouched in my bid at reaching and bringing everyone to the table for our desired success to be achieved,” he said. He added that since his emergence, he has been moving round the state to preach peace among its members, stressing that the response has been encouraging. In addition to his effort at reaching out to the aggrieved, Babayemi said further that a committee would soon be put in place to ensure that total peace and normalcy return to the party before the governorship election. According to him, the people of the state in general were eagerly awaiting a new administration of the PDP to be headed by him as the governor, charging that all hands must be on deck not to circumvent it. “By the grace of God, we are some metres away from reaching our goal of taking over from the APC in the state. Our people have had enough of their misgovernance which has continued to have telling effects on them in all spheres of life,” he lamented. He called on the people of the state to continue to be law-abiding by always maintaining peace and order, insisting that; “without peace, nothing can be achieved.”
