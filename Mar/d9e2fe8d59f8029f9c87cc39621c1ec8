 BY AGNES NWORIE, ABAKALIKI The Independent National Electoral Commission says it has suspended actions on the case bothering on the defection of Governor David Umahi of Ebonyi state, his deputy and the 16 state assembly lawmakers. The Commission gave the indication in a statement dated March 24, signed by Festus Okoye, National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, stating that it had 12 court processes on the matter. The statement read that the Commission suspended action on the case of defection by the governor, the deputy-governor and 16 members of the Ebonyi State House of Assembly from the Peoples Democratic Party to the All Progressives Congress in the light of the conflicting orders by courts. It read, “The Independent National Electoral Commission met today, Thursday, 24th March, and deliberated on a wide range of issues, including preparations for the Osun State governorship election and cases on the defection of the governor and deputy-governor of Ebonyi State and 16 members of the state House of Assembly from the PDP to the APC. “It will be recalled that the Commission met on Thursday, 17th March, on the matter, decided to defer its deliberation on the Ebonyi cases and stepped down the Memorandum to enable its Legal Services and Clearance Committee to study the new processes served on it in the light of the previously served ones and advise the Commission comprehensively. “Since then, the Commission has been served yet more court processes on the same matter bringing the total to 12. The Commission deliberated extensively on these cases and decided to further suspend action on the defection of the governor and deputy-governor of Ebonyi State and 16 members of the State House of Assembly from the PDP to APC in the light of the conflicting judgements and orders served on it from courts of coordinate jurisdiction. “The Commission also considers it prudent to stay action on the conflicting judgements and orders being aware of the pendency of Appeals and Motions for Stay of Execution of some of the judgements before various divisions of the Court of Appeal.”
