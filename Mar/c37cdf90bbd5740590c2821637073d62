 The Senate, on Wednesday, turned down President Muhammdu Buhari’s Bill seeking to amend the Electoral Act, 2022. Titled, ‘A Bill for an Act to amend the Electoral Act 2022 and for related matters, 2022,’ it was overwhelming rejected by Senators. With this development, its second reading was brought to an abrupt end as it was thrown out on Wednesday during plenary. The Bill had, on Tuesday, scaled first reading despite a court order stopping the Senate from acting on it. The President of the Senate, Senator, Ahmad Lawan, challenged the court order, saying that the judiciary could not, in any circumstance, stop the legislature from performing its constitutional duties. Prior to the commencement of consideration of the Bill on Wednesday, Senator Adamu Aliero, APC, Kebbi while citing order 52(5) of the Senate Standing Rules, urged the  President of the Senate to throw away the proposed action on the Bill. Lawan was however, adamant  reiterating that only Senators may reject the Bill and not the judiciary seeking to stop the chamber from performing its lawful duties through an order. Senators, however, voted overwhelmingly against the Bill to stop it from being read a second time.
