 Activist Omoyele Sowore, on Tuesday, declared his intention to contest for president in the 2023 general elections. Sowore made his aspiration public in Abuja, explaining that he would run a socialist government by focusing on workers’ welfare, providing free education, creating job and making pension reforms. The publisher of Sahara Reporters stated that he would create a new Constitution for the country and release detained leaders of the various movements agitating for self-determination, particularly Mazi Nnamdi Kanu of the Indigenous People of Biafra and Sunday Igboho of the Yoruba Nation Group if elected for the job. Sowore said, “Nigerian workers, a living wage is coming your way. What I am saying to you is that an N100,000 monthly minimum wage is too small (for Nigerian workers today). Nigerian students, help is coming your way because we will give you free and qualitative education with bursary, grants, and scholarships. “To the unemployed young people of Nigeria, I can only promise you one thing – jobs. I am also going to reform the pension system. For those who are pushing the struggle for self-determination, we will accord you the opportunity you are seeking by creating a new Constitution for Nigeria, which must necessarily contain the right to self-determination and the right to a referendum if you are tired of Nigeria. “As soon as I am sworn-in on June 12, 2023, I will release all political detainees, particularly (Nnamdi) Kanu and Sunday Igboho. People who are asking for self-determination should not go to prison. Those in the Diaspora must also be given the right to vote during the election.” According to him, Nigeria may not win the war against terrorism without improving the welfare and working conditions of the troops.
