 The national leader of the All Progressives Congress, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, has cancelled the 13th Birthday Colloquium over a terrorist attack on a Kaduna-bound train on Monday. The colloquium was slated for Tuesday in Lagos in commemoration of Tinubu’s 70th birthday with the theme ‘ Pivoting Nigeria Into The New Order’. The APC presidential aspirant urged clerics and everyone present to pray to God to help Nigeria win the war against terrorism. He said that as a senior citizen, he cannot be celebrating while others are in sorrow. He asked everyone to go back home and pray for Nigeria. Tinubu noted that his birthday should be marked in sober reflection and prayer for the country. He said, “This event should not be holding. I hereby cancel this colloquium due to the incident of Kaduna. I urge you all to pray that Nigeria win this war against evil,” he said at the Eko Hotels venue of the event.
