 The Independent National Electoral Commission has confirmed Senator Ademola Adeleke as the People’s Democratic Party candidate for the July 16 governorship election in Osun State. Adeleke’s name appeared as the PDP candidate in the final list of governorship candidates released by the Commission on Friday. Prince Dotun Babayemi had initially challenged Adeleke’s candidature, but the list put to rest the bickering over who the authentic PDP candidate in Osun State is. INEC also confirmed Governor Adegboyega Oyetola as the candidate of the All Progressives Congress in the coming poll. Other governorship candidates listed by the INEC include Omigbodun Oyegoke of the Social Democratic Party; Abede Adetona Samuel, National Rescue Mission; Oyelekan Akingbade of Labour Party; Adebayo Adeolu Elisha, Action Peoples Party; Awoyemi Oluwatayo, Allied Peoples Movement; and Awojide Peter Segun of African Action Congress. Others are Akande Victor Babalola, Accord Party; Adesuyi John Olufemi, Zenith Labour Party; Kehinde Munirudeen Atanda of Action Democratic Party; Ademola Bayonle Adeseye of Young Progressives Party; Ayowole Olubusuyi Adedeji, Peoples Redemption Party; Saliu Rasak Oyelami of New Nigeria Peoples Party; and Adeleke Adesoji Masilo Aderemi, Boot Party. However, INEC disqualified three parties, namely Action Alliance, All Progressives Grand Alliance and African Democratic Congress for not meeting the guidelines for the exercise.
