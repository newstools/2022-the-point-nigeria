 BY AKINWALE ABOLUWADE, IBADAN In the light of the controversies trailing the appointment of Jagun in the two ruling lines of the Olubadan chieftaincy system, (Olubadan and Balogun) three letters purportedly emanating from the Olubadan Palace have been allegedly cancelled. The three letters, two for Jagun Balogun and one for Jagun Olubadan, went viral on the social media on Tuesday. The Olubadan of Ibadanland, Oba Lekan Balogun, was said to have attributed the development to administrative error, stating that the said letters had already been withdrawn in a bid to address the logjam. The monarch, however, assured the prospective occupants of the two positions of Jagun to see the development as temporary and not the end of the road as the vacant positions would be filled in due course. He enjoined those affected by the decision to remain calm while the matter was being resolved.
