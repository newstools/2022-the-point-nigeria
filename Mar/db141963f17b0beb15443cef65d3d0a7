 BY AKINWALE ABOLUWADE, IBADAN The Olubadan of Ibadanland, Oba Lekan Balogun, on Monday, sought the support of the licensed Surveyors in Oyo State in his resolve to end land grabbing. The monarch made the call while playing host to the Oyo State chapter of the Nigerian Institute of Surveyors who paid him congratulatory visit on the occasion of Global Surveyors’ Day. The Olubadan, who expressed delight at the visit, remarked that the coincidence was significant. He urged them to partner with him and the Olubadan-in-Council in order to give city a new image. He said, “We have resolved at the council level to find lasting solution to the menace of land grabbing in Ibadanland which has become a negative identity to all of us, Ibadan sons and daughters. We cannot do it alone, we want your partnership both at individual and corporate levels. “As professionals, there is nothing pertaining to land purchase that can be done outside of you, hence, the need for you to be on the same page with us by ensuring that you are engaged only by people that have genuine land documents and solid family history.” Earlier, the group, led by Lamidi Waheed Abiodun, said that the visit was to felicitate Oba Balogun on his coronation and to enjoin him to give royal support to the Institute. He explained, “We had pursued some quackery-related cases to court while some are in the offing. We are respectable and distinguished professionals who are conscious of our integrity and the ethics of our profession which we must guard jealously at all times. “We are aware too that the quacks are encouraged by the patronage they receive from the members of public and we have been on air for some time now, sensitizing the public on the danger inherent in their patronage and we are not relenting.”
