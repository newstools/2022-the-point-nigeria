 Russia’s Ministry of Defense says it would stop the bombardment of Ukraine on Saturday in order to allow civilians to flee safely. The ministry said in a statement that “Today, March 5, from 10am Moscow time, the Russian side declares a ceasefire regime and opens humanitarian corridors for the exit of civilians from Mariupol and Volnovakha. “Humanitarian corridors and exit routes have been agreed with the Ukrainian side.” Regarding attacks on civilians, Western officials stated that it noticed a shift in Russian strategy from military targets to civilians, with more attacks becoming focused on population centres. The new approach comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin failed to get the quick victory he wanted, and the Russian military has faced stiff and determined Ukrainian resistance across the country. Recall that Ukrainian and Russian delegations held the second round of talks in Belarus on Thursday. A Ukrainian negotiator said afterwards that it didn’t deliver the results that Ukraine needed as both sides had agreed on corridors for civilians to escape. Putin told German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, on Friday that the third round of talks was scheduled for this weekend. CNN.
