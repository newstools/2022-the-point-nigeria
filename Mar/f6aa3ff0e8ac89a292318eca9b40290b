 Governors in the South-West states have endorsed two former governorship aspirants in Ondo and Osun states, lsaacs Kekemeke and Senator lyiola Omisore as the national Vice-Chairman, and national Secretary, South-West of the All Progressive Congress respectively. The position of vice-chairman of the party was reported to have been zoned to Ondo, while that of the national secretary was allotted to Oyo and Osun states. A party source in Akure, Ondo State, was quoted to have said that the governors endorsed both aspirants. The Head, Kekemeke’s Media Team, Jerry Sola-Akinuli, said that the governors agreed on Kekemeke and Omisore’s candidacy. He said that “The South-West governors worked in consultation with party leaders as to how party offices should be distributed amongst the component states of the region.” Kekemeke was quoted to have said that “This convention is quite challenging for the APC because of the many contending tendencies and interests. This is not unusual in any political party. I believe that our leaders and our governors are up to the task. “The bigger job is for the post-convention leadership to have the requisite capacity to fairly and sincerely rejig the party. The APC needs a competent, experienced, large-hearted, nonsectional, and cool-headed somebody as chairman.”
