 A group called the North-East Business Forum, has obtained the forms for former Vice-President, Atiku Abubakar, shortly after the Peoples Democratic Party commenced sales of nomination and expression of interest forms for the 2023 general elections. The chairman of the Forum, Dalhatu Funakaya, while presenting the forms to Atiku at his Abuja residence, expressed trust in Atiku’s ability to put the country on the path to prosperity. Funakaya stated that the group urged with the former Vice-President to vie for the Office of the President last year and decided to walk their talk by obtaining the nomination forms for him. He said, “We made a pledge in Gombe in November 2021 and we called on him to contest and pledged to purchase nomination form for him.” He stressed that having done its part, the group was hopeful that the former Vice-President would formally declare to contest the 2023 Presidential election on the platform of the PDP. In his response, Atiku urged Nigerians to remain united to address the challenges besetting the country. Atiku said, “The challenges before us are historical; our unity is threatened. The economy is in the worst state of affairs and our security is a disaster. “This is why there must be unity to address these challenges. “The challenges before us is greater than our differences of ethnicity and religion.”
