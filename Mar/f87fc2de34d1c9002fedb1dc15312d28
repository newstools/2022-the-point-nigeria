 The National Youth Service Corps says it has launched an investigation into a viral video of corps members engaging in erotic dance at a yet-to-be identified location. A female corps member is seen giving a lap dance to a male counterpart in a video that has now gone viral on social media. Other corps members were also seen in a video engaging in erotic dance. One of the male corps member is seen hitting his organ against the female’s own, with another corps member saying, “Give am well,” meaning give it to her well. Emeka Mgbemena, NYSC’s Deputy Director of Press and Public Relations, in a statement said, “The attention of NYSC management has been drawn to a video currently trending on the social media, showing corps members supposedly in NYSC orientation camp in very compromising actions that pushed beyond the boundary of decency. “Management hereby restates that the scheme is founded on discipline, patriotism and youth-reorientation and will never condone such irresponsible behaviour. “Investigation is currently ongoing, and anyone found culpable will be treated in accordance with the bye-laws of the scheme.”
