Passengers get stranded BY AGNES NWORIE, ABAKALIKI A road accident involving a trailer and two tankers around the Ezilo Bridge in Ishielu Local Government Area of Ebonyi State has resulted in traffic gridlock along the Abakaliki-Enugu Expressway. An eyewitness, MacSylvester Ndolo, said that one of the trailers plunged into the Ezilo River. He said that the traffic gridlock in the area stretched from the scene of the crash to several kilometres on both sides of the expressway making travelers to groan. According to him, travelers coming from Enugu and Abakaliki axis were forced to disembark from their vehicles and trekked to the other side to board another vehicle to their various destinations.

As of the time of filing this report, the casualty figure had yet to be ascertained.
