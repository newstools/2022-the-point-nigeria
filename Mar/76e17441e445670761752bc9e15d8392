One of the female students who slept in the room screamed, which drew the attention of other students. As I speak, they have vacated the hostel.” The Public Relations Officer of the institution, Emmanuel Odishika, confirmed the incident. According to him, the community has a sacred snake, and from time to time students run into it, but it does not hurt anybody. “The university is over 16 years old, founded in 2005, and since then, the snake never hurts anybody. The snake is not harmful. “We usually give students orientation whenever we admit; older students don’t panic because they are aware of it. We cannot restrict the snake’s movement,” he said. Odishika added that there was no overgrown grass on the school premises, stressing that the snake did not require grass to visit the school.
