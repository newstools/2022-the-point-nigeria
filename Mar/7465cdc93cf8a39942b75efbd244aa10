 Former President Olusegun Obasanjo, on Tuesday, visited the Olubadan designate, Senator Lekan Balogun, for a brief meeting. Obasanjo, who arrived at Balogun’s Alarere residence, Ibadan without a large entourage, was led to the place by Gbenga Adewusi, former Chairman, Ibadan North-East Local Government Area of Oyo State. Shortly after his arrival at the residence, the duo went into a private meeting that lasted about five minutes. The former president who jovially reminded the Olubadan that he did not prostate for him, promised to do so next time. Balogun, a Senator during the first term of Chief Obasanjo as President between 1999 and 2003, described his visit as a meeting of brothers, recalling that the former president had sent emissaries to him some weeks ago. The incoming Olubadan said, “though the visit was short, it was fruitful and very presidential.”
