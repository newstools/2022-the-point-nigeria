 Olaiya Kupolati, Senior Special Assistant to Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State on Electoral Matters, has resigned his appointment to support the aspiration of former Governor Segun Oni for re-election in the June 18 governorship poll. Kupolati disclosed that he decided to defect to the Social Democratic Party to also contest for the state House of Assembly position. Fayemi’s former aide, in a letter dated 23rd March, addressed to the office of the Secretary to the State Government, said that his resignation would be effective from March 30. The letter read that his resignation was in tandem with the new Electoral Act, which stipulates that every appointee seeking political office should resign accordingly. It read, “I, Kupolati Olaiya, the Senior Special Assistant on Electoral Matters, hereby resigns my position with effect from 30th March, 2022. “I really appreciate Mr Governor for giving me the opportunity to serve the good people of Ekiti State” While announcing his defection to the SDP at his ward in Iye Ekiti, Ilejemeje Council Area, Kupolati said that he considered the experience and pedigree of former Governor Segun Oni in his decision. ”I perceive former Governor Segun Oni as the best man for Ekiti after Governor Fayemi at this trying time and I am ready to support him. “The former governor is a man of the people, a man of integrity with unblemished records. He has a better pedigree. He performed very well while in office in his first term, so he deserves reelection by every standard. “I am also following the trend in town, especially my people in Ilejemeje. They are totally for Segun Oni and, as a good leader and community person, I don’t want to work against the wish of my constituents.” He said that if he did otherwise, he would have betrayed the trust of his people in the June 18 governorship poll. Kupolati is eyeing the House of Assembly race to represent the Ilejemeje state constituency in the 2023 election.
