 BY AKINWALE ABOLUWADE Some unidentified gunmen have reportedly killed Fatimah, a daughter to the former Iyalode of Ibadanland, late Chief Aminat Abiodun, in Ibadan. A family source was quoted as saying that the deceased was shot dead in an attack by the suspected killers. The attackers reportedly stormed her Basorun residence, near Bodija, Ibadan. “I was just told that our sister, daughter of the late Iyalode Abiodun, was assassinated in Basorun, Bodija area of Ibadan. “It was an unprovoked attack in her house given that Fatimah was a peace-loving person. Information I have says she was shot several times by the gunmen. “Her influence had grown over the years and she used everything she had to promote humanity. This is a big loss to the family. I don’t have more information at this moment,” the family source said.
