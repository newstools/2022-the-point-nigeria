 BY MAYOWA SAMUEL Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello, has mourned the death of Emmanuel Yawe, spokesman of the Arewa Consultative Forum. Yawe, had reportedly died in his sleep on March 10, 2022. “Yawe was a vibrant journalist who ensured that the interest of the country was protected in the media space. Until his death he sat on the board of different newspapers like People’s Daily Newspaper, The Point Newspaper and several others, where he contributed to editorial directions and administrative activities,” the Governor said in a statement issued by his Chief Press Secretary, Onogwu Mohammed. He noted that even when Yawe bowed out of active journalistic duties, he did not relent in wielding the power of the pen as the publicity secretary of Arewa Consultative Forum, a socio-political fostering unity in Northern Nigeria. The Governor, however, extended condolences to the family of the deceased, management of the newspapers where he previously served and the ACF. He prayed that God will grant him eternal rest, and his family, a fortitude to bear the loss.
