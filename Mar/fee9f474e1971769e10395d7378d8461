 About 115 young Nigerians, on Tuesday, offered to join Ukraine in the fight against Russia. The development came as some Nigerians in Ukraine struggled to return home. The young volunteers wrote down their names in a register provided by the Ukraine Embassy in Abuja. The Second Secretary, Ukraine Embassy, Bohdan Soltys, said that no step had yet been taken on the gesture by the volunteers. Report says that the volunteers may have been responding to a recent call by Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky, urging people around the world to join the fight. The Ukrainian President, in a statement on Sunday, accused the Russian army of killing civilians and praised Ukrainians for having the courage to defend themselves. He said that the assault by Russia was not just “Russia’s invasion of Ukraine” but also the beginning of a war against democracy and basic human rights. Zelensky had called on anyone who wished to join the defense of Ukraine, Europe and the world to come and fight side by side with Ukrainians. Meanwhile, the Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria had faulted President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration on the slow response to the evacuation of Nigerians in Ukraine. The group, in a statement by its national coordinator, Emmanuel Onwubiko, “Like other aspects, President Muhammadu Buhari’s presidency fumbled again. “This time, woefully, because it failed to effectively and timeously evacuate Nigerians from Ukraine many weeks before the eventual war started, following the needless invasion of Ukraine by Russia on the illegal orders of President Vladimir Putin.”
