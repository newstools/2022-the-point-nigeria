 At least seven people, including a young female doctor identified as Megafu Chinelo, have been reportedly feared dead in the terrorists’ attack of Abuja-Kaduna train, on Monday night. The yet-to-be-identified gunmen were reported to have blown up the rail track thereby causing the train to derail. The terrorists, who swooped on the train immediately after, reportedly shot indiscriminately leading to the death of, at least, seven passengers with several others injured while some were said to have been missing. Chinelo, a former staff of St Gerald’s Hospital, Kaduna, allegedly planned to relocate from the country by Friday. During the attack, the female medical doctor was said to have taken to her Twitter page asking the people to pray for her. Her tweet read, “I’m in the train. I have been shot; please pray for me.” Of the 15 passengers that were taken to St. Gerald’s Catholic Hospital in Kaduna, Chinelo and one other person were confirmed dead. One of the survivors of the attack told journalists on the phone that while in transit, “we heard a loud bang. A bomb exploded. “The earth shook and within a twinkle of an eye, it was gun shots everywhere.” Malam Ibrahim Wakkala, a former Deputy Governor of Zamfara State was among those who sustained bullets injury in the attack. The Nigerian Railway Corporation had yet to give details of the attack as well as the casualty figure. Dare Ariyo-Atoye of the Adopt a Goal Initiative, on Tuesday, condemned the attack by the terrorists just as he lamented the inability of President Muhammadu Buhari-led government to tackle insecurity in the country.
