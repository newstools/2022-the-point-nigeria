 BY AGNES NWORIE, ABAKALIKI The Chairman of the All Progressives Congress in Ebonyi State, Stanley Okoro-Emegha, has lauded the judiciary for upholding the nation’s constitution by quashing the suit challenging the defection of Governor David Umahi and his Deputy, Dr Kelechi Igwe, from the People’s Democratic Party to the ruling All Progressives Congress. Okoro-Emegha spoke after the court’s verdict delivered by Justice Henry Njoku. The judge noted that the suit was lacking in merit and, thereby, awarded N500,000 cost against the plaintiff. Emegha, who said that the judgement was anticipated because the provisions of the constitution on the matter were clear, appreciated the Ebonyi people for voting in Governor Umahi’s in the first place. He said that “In all honesty, for the right thinking citizens like us who participated in the last general elections, we all knew that the electorate voted massively for Governor David Umahi because of his achievements in his first tenure.” He said that although the court action did not distract the governor from delivering good governance, he noted that “The verdict has reaffirmed the saying that the judiciary is truly the last hope of the common man. It has also given more strengthen and hope to the Nigerian people that the judiciary is still very strong and unbiased. “To the family of the ruling APC, this is a welcome development. The battle is over and the governor still remains the number one citizen of the state.”
