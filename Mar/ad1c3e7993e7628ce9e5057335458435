 BY MAYOWA SAMUEL The acting chairman of the Caretaker/Extra-ordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) Abubakar Sani-Bello has inaugurated chairmen and secretaries of sub-committees for the March 26th National Convention. Stating that the convention date is sacrosanct, the APC chairman explained that the new panels are being reduced to a manageable size for effective delivery.
