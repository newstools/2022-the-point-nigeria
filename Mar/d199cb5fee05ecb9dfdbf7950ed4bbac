 A High Court sitting in Lagos has sentenced Udochukwu Anyanwu and Udo Chibike (a.k.a Lasis), both Senior Secondary School leavers, to seven-year-imprisonment each for stealing a piano in a church. The duo, who were remanded in prison on January 19, 2017 by a Lagos Magistrates Court, were later arraigned on 27the June, 2018, before Justice Yetunde Adesanya on allegations of conspiracy to rob. The prosecuting counsel, A. O. Oluwafemi (a Deputy Director of Public Prosecution), called three witnesses and tendered exhibits. In the course of the trial, Anyanwu and Chibike on February 4, 2019, faced a trial within the trial which was later dismissed on the basis of a prima facie case against them. When the case came up on March 4, 2022, the convicts opted for a plea bargain agreement and the matter was adjourned till March 29, 2022 for sentence. Anyanwu and Chibike, who were re-arraigned on a one-count amended charge of stealing before Justice Adesanya, on Tuesday, changed their not guilty plea to guilty. Justice Adesanya sentenced the accused persons after they pleaded guilty to a plea bargain agreement. The judge held that the term of the imprisonment would start from the day they were first remanded in prison on January 19, 2017. She said, “The court has ascertained from the defendants that they entered into the plea bargain agreement on their own free volition, free from any coercion and that nobody promised them. “I have considered the plea bargain and sentencing agreement, which was agreed and duly executed between the parties. I am persuaded that the terms of the agreement are just. “I, hereby, convict you, Udochukwu Anyanwu and Udo Chibike, of the offence of stealing and you are guilty as charged.”
