 BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO Osun State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola on Tuesday appealed to indigenes of Ile-Ife who are protesting the choice of the new Vice Chancellor for the Obafemi Awolowo University to give peace a chance and stop the protest forthwith. In a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Ismail Omipidan, Oyetola noted that Ivory Towers any where in the world is a sacred place and everything must be done to accord it that dignity. He noted that though the state has no role  in the choice of who becomes the Vice Chancellor of Obafemi Awolowo University, being a Federal institution, he has responsibility for the safety and security of the institution and its workers as the host governor. To this end, he urged all protesting citizens to exercise restraint and allow peace to reign. He further said, “It is with heavy heart and a deep sense of concern that I call on the good people of Ile-Ife, especially those protesting over the choice of a new Vice Chancellor  for Obafemi Awolowo University, OAU, to stop further protest and give peace a chance. “By their nature and functionality, universities are rules- and convention-based conservative institutions premised on academic and governance autonomy. “If we have any reason to believe that these rules are circumvented, there are laid-down procedures to remedy such situations rather than resorting to self-help. We are known for peace in Osun. We must therefore not do anything to tarnish that enviable reputation, “ Oyetola added.
