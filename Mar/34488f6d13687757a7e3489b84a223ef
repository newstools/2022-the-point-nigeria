 At least, six passengers have been reported dead in a fatal auto crash at the Iriebe area of Port Harcourt-Aba Expressway in Obio/Akpor Local Government Area of Rivers State. However, another report had it that 11 passengers lost their lives in the incident while the Federal Road Safety Corps confirmed three deaths in the accident. A Toyota Hiace bus loaded with passengers was said to have crashed into a stationed truck loaded with timber. The FRSC Sector Commander in the state, Salisu Galadunchi, said that the accident that happened in the early hours of the day might have been caused by poor visibility. According to him, three dead bodies were recovered from the bus. Galadunchi said, “It happened around Oyibo Eleme area. Actually, the accident happened around 6am, Wednesday morning. The vehicles involved are a Toyota Hiace bus and a truck. The Toyota bus rammed into the truck. “The truck was completely parked off the road, but because the driver of the bus was moving that early morning, and you know that early in Port Harcourt, there is poor visibility. “Because of the poor visibility, the bus went off its lane completely and entered under the parked truck. Poor visibility may have been the cause. “When we got there we met three dead bodies; two men and a woman. Police helped us in bringing them out.” He said that the dead bodies had been deposited in a mortuary while those injured were hospitalised.
