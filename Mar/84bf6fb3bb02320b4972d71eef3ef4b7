 The Borno State Police Command says it has arrested a suspected notorious fraudster who deceived unsuspecting members of the public that he possessed the power to make people wealthy. While parading the suspect in Maiduguri, on Friday, the Commissioner of Police in the Command, Abdu Umar, said that nemesis caught up with him a few weeks ago. The CP said that the module operandi of the gang was to lure their victim into believing that they had the power to communicate with the spirit world for them to amass wealth. The police chief said that the suspect, alongside his accomplices, who are now at large, lured one Bukar Muhammed by saying that they could assist him to become rich. He said that “They manipulated and directed him to go and drop his Automated Teller Machine card and the pin number at a certain location. “The victim complied and the suspects withdrew the sum of N2.2 million from his account domiciled at TAJ Bank Plc.” He added that the suspect was trailed and arrested in February, alleging that he confessed to the crime and other offences. According to the CP, efforts to arrest the two other accomplices have been intensified.
