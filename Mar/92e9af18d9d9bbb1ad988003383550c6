 BY BAMIDELE FAMOOFO The 2019 Audited Financial Statement of Oando Plc, one of Nigeria’s leading oil marketing companies, will not be available to its shareholders and investors until after April ending. Earlier, the company had announced that the financial performance document would be made available to the Nigerian Exchange Limited before end of first quarter in 2022. A statement signed by the Chief Compliance Officer & Company Secretary, Ayotola Jagun, disclosed that the audit is taking longer than expected due to the mandatory audit of post balance sheet events that have occurred subsequent to the 2019 reporting period. “We hereby confirm that the 2019 audit is in the finalization stage. We envisage that the board of directors will be able to approve the 2019 AFS on or before April 30, 2022. Following the approval, management and the auditors will approach the Financial Reporting Council for final approval and release of the financial statements.” The audited financial report for the financial years ended 2020 and 2021 are tentatively slated for July and October 2022 respectively. “The Company sincerely apologises for any inconvenience caused as concerted efforts are being made to finalise the accounts with the external auditors and to ensure that the Company is in full compliance with its regulatory requirements. The Company will continue to comply with other continuous disclosure requirements within the time prescribed by applicable regulations,” Jagun stated.
