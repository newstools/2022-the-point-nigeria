 Fuel scarcity has worsened in Makurdi, Benue State as a litre now sells for N450. Many car owners reportedly abandoned their vehicles at home as most filling stations closed shop due to lack of supply. It was gathered that aside from the NNPC Mega Station and two other independent petroleum marketers who are dispensing to motorists within the state capital, other filling stations had been out of business for two weeks. Transport fares had been jerked up by commercial motorcycle and shuttle bus operators who complained about the biting petrol scarcity. Checks showed that transport fares had been increased by 100 per cent as commuters paid N200 to destinations where they used to pay N100. A commercial motorcyclist, who identified himself as Ben Ojor, said that the petrol scarcity affected the smooth running of his business. Ojor said that commercial motorcycle operators sourced petrol from black market for as much as N450 in order to remain in business. He lamented that “We can hardly get fuel from filling station in Makurdi as we talk. If you get to the NNPC Mega Station, motorbike owners find it very difficult to access the gate of the station because it is like the entire car owners in Makurdi have taken over the place. “So if we must be in business, we need to buy from roadside sellers who sell a litre for about N450.”
