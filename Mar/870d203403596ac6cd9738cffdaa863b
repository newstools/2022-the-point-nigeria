 The unity list for the convention of the ruling All Progressives Congress on Saturday would be released today, Governor Abdullahi Sule of Nasarawa State, who doubles as the Chairman, National Convention Media and Publicity Sub-Committee of the party, has said. According to Sule, some geopolitical zones have already agreed on the list which would later be published today. While addressing a pre-convention conference on Friday in Abuja, the governor confirmed that the consensus arrangement remained the first option to elect the new leaders of the party. He said, “From what we have on the various regions, the unity list will be ready today. It will be submitted. If you are talking of consensus, you must have a unity list, because that’s the whole essence of consensus. “If you’re having consensus, you’re going to have people who have agreed, aspirants who have agreed, stakeholders who have agreed, and also the constituency that has agreed, and in that case, that name automatically will be adopted. And, that’s just the meaning of the unity list.”
