 BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO A 20-year-old artisanal gold miner, Ibraheem Kazeem, has been remanded in Ilesa Correctional Centre by an Osogbo Magistrate’s court over the alleged murder of a Police Inspector, Adeoye Banjo. The Police in the state arraigned Kazeem on two counts bothering on conspiracy to commit felony to wit murder. It was gathered that late Banjo was one of the police orderly guarding some Chinese miners in the state who were attacked by some gunmen in 2019. Banjo was allegedly shot dead in the attack. During a police investigation, Banjo’s SIM card was traced to Kazeem. When the police carried out a search on the defendant’s apartment, the SIM card belonging to the late police officer was allegedly found. He was subsequently arrested and docked. Police prosecutor, Inspector Olufemi Olanibi, told the court that Kazeem and others now at large, on November 25, 2019 in Osogbo, conspired to commit felony to wit murder of Banjo. The second count against him partly read that “Ibraheem Kazeem did unlawfully cause the death of one Adeoye Banjo attached to Special Protection Unit Zone XI, Osogbo.” Olanibi said that the defendant committed offences contrary to and punishable under sections 324 and 319(1) of the Criminal Code, Cap 34, Volume II, Laws of Osun State, 2002. The court turned down the defendant’s plea owing to the severity of the charge brought against him. The defense counsel, S. O. Abiona, urged the court to order the prosecution to avail him a copy of the acknowledgement of the duplicate of the case file that was forwarded to the Department of Public Prosecution in the state Ministry of Justice for legal advice. Magistrate M. A. Olatunji granted the counsel’s prayer and ordered that the defendant should be remanded in Ilesa Correctional facility pending DPP’s legal advice.
