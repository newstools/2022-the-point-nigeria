 As the four-week warning strike by the National Executive Council of the Academic Staff Union of Universities elapses on Monday, the union is billed to meet on Sunday in Abuja on the next line of action. Prof. Emmanuel Osodeke, National President of ASUU was quoted, on Saturday, as saying that the NEC would decide what to do next. Osodeke said that “I cannot say this is what we are going to do next. It is the NEC that is going to decide that and we are having our NEC meeting on Sunday. “We are an organised union and the majority opinion carries the day. Whatever the meeting decides will be communicated to all, thank you.” The decision by the union to embark one month warning strike to press home its points with the Federal Government was taken at a meeting held, four weeks ago, at the University of Lagos, Akoka. Although the union met with the Federal Government during the warning strike, no truce was arrived at. The Federal Government said recently that the University Transparency and Accountability System that was developed by ASUU to replace the Integrated Personnel Payroll Information System as a payment platform for the universities lacked integrity. Dr Chris Ngige, Minister of Labour,  had urged the Nigeria Labour Congress to call ASUU to order in a bid to address the current logjam.
