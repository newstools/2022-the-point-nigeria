 There are indications that the Academic Staff Union of Universities may begin an indefinite strike today (Monday) as the Federal Government says it will not enter into forced agreements with the union. Although the National President of ASUU, Emmanuel Osodeke, did not give details of its NEC meeting, a source within the NEC was quoted as saying that the union was ready to embark on full blown strike as the government failed to meet its demands. He said, “The government has not done any tangible thing since the announcement of the warning strike. As much as we are not happy about going on strike, I am afraid to say that we have no choice this time. However, the final decision lies with the NEC.” Following the meeting by the National Executive Council of the union at the University of Abuja, it is expected to announce its decision on strike today (Monday). Meanwhile, the Ministry of Education has urged ASUU to call off its strike. Ben Goong, spokesman to the ministry reportedly said on Sunday that the ministry would neither have gunpoint negotiations nor make promises that could not be fulfilled. Goong stated, “If I were ASUU, I would call off the strike and that is what we are telling ASUU to do. Call off the strike so that nobody will be negotiating out of duress. “If you continue the strike, we will have agreements at gunpoint with you. “If they stay on the strike, in a desperate attempt to make sure that the universities are re-opened, we will make agreements under duress. We are not in a state of war that you must be on strike before you negotiate. “You say it is a warning strike and the government has begun the implementation of agreements, it is only normal that you call off your strike, but it is as if they have that mindset of a strike.”
