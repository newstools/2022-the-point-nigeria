 BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO Governor Gboyega Oyetola of Osun State on Wednesday urged electorate in the state to safeguard their Permanent Voter Cards ahead of the July 16 gubernatorial election in the state. Oyetola made the appeal during an engagement programme with Nigeria Professional Photographers and Videographers Association in Osogbo. Represented by his Special Adviser on Civic Engagement, Mr Olatunbosun Oyintiloye, the governor appealed to them not to allow any individual to deceive them with ‘fake promises’ in order to steal their PVCs from them. The governor, who noted that the strength of the electorate is his or her PVC, urged them to jealously guard it and desist from selling it to desperate politicians. Oyetola also urged those who are yet to obtain their PVC to take advantage of the ongoing Continous Voters Registration of Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and get theirs. “Some people will want to collect your PVC with the pretence of giving you money or material things. They are all liars, those things that they did not give you two years ago, they are lying to give you a few months to the election. “Our election is coming up on July 16, I appeal to you to get your PVC and use the same to support me and APC. Your PVC is your power. Don’t trade it with fake promises and always keep it safe. Use your PVC to protect and keep in office the administration that is serving you diligently,” he said. Oyetola, who expressed optimism that APC would win the governorship election convincingly with a clear margin, commended the people of the state for their support since the beginning of his administration. He said he would continue to prioritise their welfare and also protect their interest.
