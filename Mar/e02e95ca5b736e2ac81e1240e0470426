 BY FOLASHADE KEHINDE Facts emerged on Thursday that the Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni, planned to return as the Chairman of the Caretaker Committee of the All Progressives Congress after returning to the country from his medical leave. He also duly transferred power to Governor Sani Bello of Niger State in a leaked letter on Wednesday, contrary to the claims of Governor Nasir el-Rufai of Kaduna State. His letter to the APC, dated February 28, and sent to the Niger State Governor, Sani Bello, and other members of the party’s caretaker committee read that he (Buni) would resume office after being discharged from the hospital. “This is to inform you that I will be embarking on a medical trip to the United Arab Emirates from today, February 28, 2022. I will resume office upon my discharge from the hospital,” the letter read in part. Addressing Bello, Buni’s letter further read, “In my absence, I hereby transmit the functions of my office as the National Chairman of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee to you. “This is to enable the committee to conclude all arrangements leading to the national convention slated for March 26, 2022, and other duties that may be required of the office. “I invite all members to cooperate with Governor Abubakar Sani Bello by extending to him all the support that I have enjoyed from you.” On Wednesday, Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State said that although Buni willingly transmitted power to Bello, it was discovered that Buni’s committee planned to postpone the March 26 convention on the strength of a court injunction. This claim was, however, countered in the second to the last paragraph of Buni’s letter. The Kaduna State Governor was quoted as saying that President Muhammadu Buhari instructed Bello to take over the affairs of the party permanently. According to El-Rufai, Buni will not return as chairman of the caretaker committee. He stressed that, at least, 19 governors were in support of Bello.
