 The Senior Pastor and General Overseer of Omega Fire Ministries, Apostle Johnson Suleman, has built an hospital that would offer medical services at subsidized rate of 50per cent to patients. The Apostle also built a free restaurant to feed, at least, 1000 people daily. These were said to have been established to mark the clergyman’s birthday coming up on 24th of March. Report had it that the restaurant would open tomorrow (Saturday) by 11am with the celebrant, dignitaries and beneficiaries in attendance to witness the unveiling. The restaurant was said to have been built in a bid to feed the poor to help cushion the effect of the biting economic hardship in the land. Apostle Suleman had been variously acknowledged for his humanitarian postures. One of the doctors at the health facility, Dr. Ifijeh Patrick, said that the gesture was aimed at helping the people to access affordable and quality healthcare. Dr. Patrick said, “If you consider what we are doing, the quality of services that we render, it’s almost free.”
