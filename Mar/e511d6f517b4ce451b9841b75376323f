 The Tsafe-Yankara Road and the Kaduna-Abuja Highway were reportedly under bandits’ attack on Tuesday leaving many travellers stranded. Eyewitnesses said that travellers scampered for safety as gunmen fired gunshots indiscriminately. The attack occurred barely 24 hours after an Abuja-Kaduna bound train was bombed with improvised explosive devices. The number of fatalities, during the terrorists’ attack of the train with about 1,000 people on board had yet to be ascertained. Several passengers were said to have been injured in the ambush. During his visit to the scene, the Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Farouq Yahaya, said that those who were kidnapped would be rescued. The Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba, also visited the scene of the train attack between Katari and Rijana. The Police Public Relations Officer, Muyiwa Adejobi, said that the security chiefs would meet to rejig the operational strategies of the security agencies in a bid to avert a recurrence.
