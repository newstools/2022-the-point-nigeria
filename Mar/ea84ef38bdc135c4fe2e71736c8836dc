 No fewer than 500 women and youths have been empowered with N25 million by the Aisha Abubakar Malami Centre for Women Development in Kebbi State. This, according to the centre, is in a bid to reduce poverty and ensure that women and youths are self-reliant. The beneficiaries were said to have been selected from across the 225 wards in the state. The founder of the centre, Hajiya Aisha Abubakar-Malami, wife of the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, said that the money would serve as start-up capitals for the beneficiaries to establish their own businesses and enable them to become productive members of the society. In her address at the programme in Birnin Kebbi recently, she said that the initiative was aimed at promoting women and youth empowerment through entrepreneurship, education and enlightenment programmes. She stated that “The women and youth leaders from the 225 wards in the 21 local governments from across the state will be given N50,000 each.”
