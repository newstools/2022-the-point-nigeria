 Parents of Adam Ennis, a Scottish garage owner, were in shock as they discovered that their son went to fight in Ukraine after failing to meet them at the airport on their return from holiday. Ennis, 35, from Biggar, south west of Edinburgh, reportedly left Scotland to join 50 men from around the world to defend the streets of Kyiv. Brian, his father, who was in Thailand with his wife and daughter for three months, told BBC Scotland that it was a shock to discover their son had gone to fight. He said, “Adam was due to pick us up at the airport but his friend picked us up instead. “His friend wasn’t going to say anything until Adam spoke to us, so we weren’t aware until he phoned us that evening. “He was already in Ukraine at a camp.” Ennis junior had no military experience but his father said that he knows how to handle weapons. The man expressed worries over his son’s safety just as he said that he was also proud of his decision to support Ukraine. “As any parents, you never want to see a loved one in any danger and it has caused us a lot of anxious nights. “We are worried but he has done it for the right reasons. He hasn’t done it for glory, he is not silly. He is a level-headed person and when he got there he said he had no regrets,” he said. Meanwhile, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said that any Scot wishing to fight should “think carefully about what we can do to support Ukraine that is actually helpful and meaningful.” She previously said she would not encourage people with no military experience or training to go and fight. UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has also urged Britons not to travel to Ukraine to join the fighting as he said that the ‘very dangerous’ situation could lead to them being killed. He added that there were better ways to contribute to the security of Ukraine. (dpa/NAN)
