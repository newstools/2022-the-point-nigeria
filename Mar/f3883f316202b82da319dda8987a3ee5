Benue State governor, Samuel Ortom, has dismissed claims by Chief Philip Agbese, an All Progressives Congress chief, that he was planning to dump the People’s Democratic Party for the APC. Governor Ortom expressed shock at what he described as the ‘baseless statement by Agbese,’ a House of Representatives aspirant. The APC aspirant claimed that the governor confided in him to plead with the wife of an APC leader in Makurdi to accept him back into the APC. A statement issued on Sunday in Makurdi by Chief Press Secretary to Governor Ortom, Nathaniel Ikyur, however, read that “I have never met that young man who calls himself Philip Agbese, so, there is no way I would have whispered to him on any issue not to talk of returning to the APC. And why should I return to the APC? “What will I be doing in a party that has destroyed Benue, wrecked Nigeria to its knees? In any case, why should I confide or whisper to someone I have never met? “If that young man wants to use my name to climb to wherever he wants to go, then he has failed. I am an enigma. I cannot condescend to the level of engaging with people who are going about looking for crumbs just to fill their stomach against the general well being of the people. “That young man is a serial liar who wants to draw attention to himself using my name. There is no truth in that claim. Whoever thinks that I, Governor Samuel Ortom, will dump the PDP now when I am part of the leadership of the party mapping out plans to rescue Nigeria from the APC led by President Muhammadu Buhari administration must be joking. “Let me make it clear, I am not contemplating rejoining the APC at any time. I am in the forefront, working with other leaders of the PDP, to ensure that the party rescues Nigeria from the cluelessness of the APC to win the presidency and other states as well as retain power here in the state.”
