 Delegates from Edo State reportedly sent Minister of Health, Dr. Osage Ehanire, away from the state’s designated stand at the Eagle Square venue of the national convention of the All Progressives Congress. The perturbed minister was said to have left the scene with his aides to the VIP stand to avoid unforseen circumstances. The entrance of the APC convention arena reportedly turned rowdy with many people injured as it became difficult for security personnel to control the crowd trying to force their way in. The police were seen pushing back the people, hitting some with batons. Those selling in the area made brisk business as a bottle of water was sold for N300 as a result of high demands. A bottle of water sold for N200 in the morning but rose to N300 in the afternoon. One of the sellers said, “I came here with a truck load of water in the morning, but it has all been sold. I tried to get another truck but the road is already blocked by security agents for security reasons; that is why the price is high.” Another seller, who claimed that he recorded high sales at the convention, said, “Naturally, we have to build in the additional cost, so that is why the price is higher.” Local musicians and praise singers took advantage of the convention to make brisk business as some delegates pelted some naira notes on them.
