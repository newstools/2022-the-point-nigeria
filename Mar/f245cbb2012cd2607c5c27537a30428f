BY AGNES NWORIE, ABAKALIKI Sequel to a motion ex parte filed by three members of Ebonyi State House of Assembly as plaintiffs against the declaration of their seats vacant, the Abuja Division of the Federal Court presided over by Justice I. E Ekwo  has restated Odefa Obasi as the Deputy Speaker of Ebonyi State House of Assembly. The court also restored the seats of two other lawmakers, Ngọzi Eziulo representing Afikpo North East and his Ivo counterpart, Oliver Osi . It further barred the House of Assembly, the Speaker, and the Clerk from carrying out any action that will affect the membership of the three lawmakers. It will be recalled that the House had last month declared the seat of Odefa and the two other lawmakers vacant. The Assembly claimed Odefa wrote a letter resigning his membership of the House, an allegation Odefa denied. The House also elected Ogbonnaya Ikoro as the new deputy speaker. The House said it declared the seats of the two other lawmakers vacant for their alleged resignation from their party, People’s Democratic Party and defecting to the APC. The lawmakers denied resigning their seats and headed to the Abuja Division of the High Court to reclaim their seats and positions which they said was wrongly taken away from them. According to court records, the Judge barred the defendants from effecting any change to the status of the trio pending the determination of the motion on notice. Hence, Justice Ekwo ordered all parties in the matter to maintain the status quo that hitherto existed before the House took their decisions against the trio last month, pending determination of the motion on notice.
