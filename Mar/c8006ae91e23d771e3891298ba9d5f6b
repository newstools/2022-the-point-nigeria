 The Tertiary Education Trust Fund has released the sum of N1billion  to the Federal University Lokoja to construct its Senate Building. The Vice-Chancellor of the university, Prof. Olayemi Akinwumi, made the disclosure on Tuesday during the commissioning of some projects that were executed at Adankolo and Felele campuses of the institution. Akinwumi described the release of the fund as “very timely” and “heart warming” considering the burning desire of the management to improve on infrastructural development of the university. The VC announced that with the release of the N1billion, work on the Senate Building would soon commence “as necessary arrangements have been concluded with the contractors. “We are equally calling on public spirited individuals and corporate organisations to partner with government in its efforts to provide infrastructural facilities for institutions of higher learning across the country. “This has become necessary to underscore the dire need for collaboration between government and corporate organisations to put quality infrastructures for conducive learning environment in Nigerian universities.” The News Agency of Nigeria reports that projects inaugurated included the University Printing Press at Adankolo Campus, the University Signage and network of access roads linking faculties in the university, alongside tree planting at the permanent site.
