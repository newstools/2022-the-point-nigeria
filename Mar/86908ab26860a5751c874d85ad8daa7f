 The Arewa Consultative Youths Movement has celebrated the judgment of the Federal High Court, Umuahia, on Friday, nullifying Section 84 (12)  of the newly amended Electoral Act. The Arewa youths, in a statement made public, on Saturday, said that the judgment, which affirmed that the controversial section was a violation of the provisions of the nation’s constitution, deserved to be celebrated. The statement quoted the youths wing of Arewa as saying that with the judgment, the coast had become clear for public office holders who were discriminated against by the section to exercise their right to participate fully in political parties’ conventions and primaries as enshrined in the constitution. The statement read, “We, Arewa youths, from the Northern part of this country celebrate this landmark judgment which we believe will further deepen the nation’s democracy. “We are of the view that the judgment is a victory for rule of law because it will further widen the democratic space for all interested Nigerians to participate, irrespective of the offices they currently occupy. “We celebrate the judgment and we also salute the courage of Justice Evelyn Anyadike who delivered the sound judgment.”
