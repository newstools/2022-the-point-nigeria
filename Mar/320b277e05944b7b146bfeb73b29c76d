 National Chairman, Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee of the All Progressives Congress, Yobe Governor, Mai Mala Buni, has dumped the national convention sub-committee list earlier adopted by the CECPC acting National Chairman, Governor Abubakar Sani Bello. Buni has also removed other members of the CECPC from the Central Coordinating sub-committee, naming only himself and CECPC National Secretary, John Akpanudoedehe as Chairman and Secretary of the sub-committee. Bello had, in Buni’s absence, on March 9 inaugurated about 20 sub-committees, declaring their membership composition as final. However, Buni whose mandate was given a fresh boost by President Muhammadu Buhari on Wednesday via a letter to the APC governors, had in his first major move cancelled the National Executive Committee NEC meeting slated for Thursday. He followed up on Thursday morning by dumping Bello’s sub-committees and reverting to his own original list. Bello had in his list dropped some people including Chief Femi Fani-Kayode while he rejigged the composition of the other sub-committees. However, Governor Babajide Sanwoolu of Lagos State who was removed as Chairman of Media and Publicity Subcommittee to head the Finance Subcommittee has now reverted to his initial role courtesy of the new list. Fani-Kayode has also now been reappointed as Deputy Chairman of the committee as opposed to Bello’s list which had named the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed as co-Chairman. In the new list, the Buni-led committee also dropped Kano State Governor, Umar Abdullahi Ganduje as Chairman of the Protocol sub-committee, naming instead, the Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello, as Chairman of the Security/Protocol sub-committee. Ganduje will now revert to his earlier role as Chairman, Subcommittee on Accreditation of Volunteers/Diplomats/Diaspora/ Observers.
