 As the national convention of the ruling All Progressives Congress progressed at the Eagle Square, Abuja today (Saturday), some of the presidential aspirants of the party engaged in subtle campaign in a ploy to have a good showing in the emergence process. Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State, Chairman of the Convention Sub-committee on Venue, met with delegates from some states in company with a former Governor of Imo State, Senator Rochas Okorocha. Okorocha was seen going round the pavilions greeting delegates from various states. Adamu Garba, who is also aspiring to become the party’s standard bearer, went round the pavilions to engage the younger delegates, giving his campaign handbills. Some of the leading presidential aspirants attracted cheers from the crowd just as some of the delegates discussed the prospects of the top contenders in hushed tone.
