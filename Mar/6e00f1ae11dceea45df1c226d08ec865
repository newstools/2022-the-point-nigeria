 The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission has denied the rumour doing the rounds in some quarters that the former Anambra State governor, Willie Obiano, has been released from detention. According to the Commission, Obiano had been transferred to Abuja today (Friday) for questioning. The former Anambra State governor was arrested by officials of the EFCC on Thursday night, while trying to catch a flight to the United States of America. Obiano set out to travel out of the country hours after handing over to his successor, Governor Chukwuma Soludo. The EFCC was quoted as saying that the alleged release of the immediate past governor from the EFCC custody was false. Wilson Uwujaren, spokesman of the Commission, was reported to have said that for further investigation, Obiano was being transferred from Lagos to Abuja.
