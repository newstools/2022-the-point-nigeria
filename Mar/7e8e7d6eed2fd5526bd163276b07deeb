 The Police in Anambra State have arrested three suspected cultists reportedly terrorizing some communities in the state. One English Beretta pistol, a locally fabricated gun and one live ammunition were said to have been recovered from the suspects. Also reportedly recovered from them were a motorcycle, N22,400 cash and substances suspected to be hard drugs. “The police operatives working on a credible information stormed a criminal hideout in Awada, Idemili North Local government area and arrested one Onyedika Okwuibe, aged 25years. “Immediate search conducted in his house led to the recovery of the English pistol and one live ammunition. “Further interrogation of Onyedika led to the arrest of one Chimaobi Ezeoke whom he alleged gave him the gun. They both confessed to be members of Vikings cult group,” the Police Public Relations Officer in the Command, Tochukwu Ikenga, said. He added that the police, working with the vigilante group at Ufuma, Orumba North Local Government Area of the state, also arrested 31-year-old Samuel Nwankwo and recovered one locally fabricated gun, one motorcycle, substances suspected to be hard drugs and N22,400 cash. Nwankwo and one other gang member still at large operating with unregistered motorcycle, the PPRO said, attacked Heca Filling Station along the Umunze/Ekwulobia Road and dispossessed the sales girl of proceeds of sales. He said that the suspects, intercepted by vigilante working with the police, had been interrogated as efforts were ongoing to nab other members of the syndicate.
