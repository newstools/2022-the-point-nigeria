 The Lagos State Government has ordered that the construction of a filling station at Number 1, Robinson Gbagi/Benson Anoruo Street, Ajao Estate, Isolo, should be stopped on account of improper documentation with the authorities. The state government also warned that whoever was caught building in Lagos without approval would be sanctioned. Dr. Idris Salako, Commissioner for Physical Planning and Urban Development, said that the filling station was being erected without any approval or stage-by-stage inspection by the Lagos State Building Control Agency to ascertain the quality of materials used. Salako said, “As a matter of fact, we cannot even be talking about checking for compliance against approval that was never given in the first place and this is dangerous for the built environment as the safety and structural integrity of the facility cannot be guaranteed.’’ The residents of the community, raising concern on the increasing number of unapproved construction, petitioned the government against the continuation of the filling station project. The Commissioner said that no construction should be carried out in the state without planning permits and stage certification. He said that the owner/developer of the filling station would be brought to book for ignoring LASBCA contravention notices and stop-work orders. He stated that actors in the built environment should “build right and team up with the state in her efforts to combat building collapse and vouchsafe a livable and sustainable physical environment as enshrined in the THEMES Agenda of the Lagos State Government.” Reiterating that enforcement by the Ministry was in accordance with standard procedures involving the service of statutory notices bearing the insignia of government, the commissioner urged Lagosians to freely report any infraction to the Ministry to avert danger.
