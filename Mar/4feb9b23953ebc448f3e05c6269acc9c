 A Federal High Court sitting in Abuja, on Monday, turned down the bail application by the suspended Deputy Commissioner of Police, Abba Kyari, and Assistant Commissioner of Police, Sunday J. Ubua. The duo were charged with offences relating to unlawful drug dealings. Justice Emeka Nwite held that the prosecution had placed sufficient materials before the court to warrant the refusal of bail to the senior police officers. In the light of the rejection of the bail application, Nwite granted an accelerated hearing of the case. The judge is reading his ruling on the bail applications by the 4th and 5th defendants – Inspector Simon Agirgba and Inspector John Nuhu.
