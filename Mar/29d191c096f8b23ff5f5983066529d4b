 The newly installed Olubadan of Ibadanland, Oba Lekan Balogun, has assured the people of Ibadanland and Nigerians in general that he would not let them down. Balogun made the pledge in his first public speech shortly after Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State presented the Staff and Instrument of Office to him as the 42nd Olubadan of Ibadanland. The monarch said, “I want to assure all that I will not let the people of Ibadan down. I will not let the people of Nigeria down.” The traditional ruler, however, thanked all the eminent personalities, including the traditional rulers, the serving and former governors and National Assembly members present for the honour done him by their presence. Governor Makinde presented the Staff and Instrument of Office to Oba Balogun as the 42nd Olubadan of Ibadanland at exactly 12:30pm. The News Agency of Nigeria reports that the programme was officially declared opened at exactly 11:14am with the recitation of National Anthem, Oyo State Anthem as well as Ibadan Anthem. The opening prayers were said by Christians, Muslims and the traditionalists. The monarch was ushered into the venue at exactly 11:50am after which the traditional chiefs, Mogajis, religious leaders and leaders of various associations in Ibadanland paid him homage. (NAN).
