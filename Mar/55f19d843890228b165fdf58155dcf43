Earlier, the Chancellor of the University, Dr David Oyedepo, said that the institution’s training was geared towards raising a new generation of leaders through a broad-based qualitative education. “The institution’s mandate is powered by our rounding philosophy of departing from skill, knowledge to empowerment, figures to future-building, legalism to realism, points to facts, mathematics to ‘life-matics,” Oyedepo said. The chancellor noted that until one was transformed, he woul not be able to reform his environment, society or nation, adding that this was why the institution focused on equipping the students. The Pro-Chancellor of the Institution, Bishop David Abioye, said that the University presented a set of life-changing core values which helped in training each student for a productive life. Abioye admonished the students to embrace the values that would enable them to excel in their various endeavours. (NAN).
