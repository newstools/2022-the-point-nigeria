 BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO The Senior Special Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on National Assembly Matters, Senator Babajide Omoworare has called on aspirants who stepped down at the recently held National Convention of the All Progressives Congress to see their sacrifices as necessity for greater good. Omoworare also charged the new leadership of the ruling party to initiate reconciliation mechanisms as a matter of priority to make the party stronger and better. In a statement issued by an aide to Omoworare, Comrade Tunde Dairo, on Monday, the former Senator felicitated with President Muhammadu Buhari for leading APC to a successful National Convention and the emergence of a new National Working Committee of the party. Omoworare also extended his felicitation to Senator Abdulahi Adamu, the newly elected National Chairman, Senator Iyiola Omisore, Secretary and the entire NWC and wished them a successful tenure of office. The former Senator of Osun East described Adamu as detribalised statesman whose political experience and capacity would count in his new assignment. “I am confident that Senator Abdulahi Adamu and his team will move the party forward and lead us to victory in the 2023 national elections. “May I also explore this medium to celebrate my kinsman and brother, Senator Iyiola Omisore the National Secretary of the APC and every other member of National Working Committee. It is important that the committee works as one to lead the party to greater victories and deliver good governance to Nigerians.” “While we all know that the onus of healing and unifying the party now lies with the leadership of the party, it is also important that we see ourselves as a family with no victor nor vanquished, we all won together. I wish you all a successful tenure of office,” Omoworare said.
