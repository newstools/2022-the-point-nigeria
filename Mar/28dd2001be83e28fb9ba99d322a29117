 Fear grips the land as report filtered in, on Monday night, that a train carrying over 900 passengers was bombed by suspected terrorists between Rijana and Katari in Kaduna State. It was learnt that the train derailed after the improvised explosive device planted by the terrorists went off. A passenger reportedly called to tell his relatives that those on board were lying on the floor as the terrorists shot at the train, sporadically. The terrorists, subsequently, attacked the train leaving some of the passengers injured. There were worries that some of the 970 passengers on board the train might have been abducted by the attackers. Security operatives were said to have been deployed to the scene of the attack. A few days ago, some terrorists attacked the Kaduna International Airport where an aircraft was prevented from taking off. An eyewitness was quoted as saying that “They (terrorists) planted IED. When it went off, it derailed the train. There was pandemonium and some people may be kidnapped.” The Managing Director of the Nigerian Railway Cooperation, Fidet Okhiria, confirmed the incident, saying that “Information concerning the attack was still sketchy, and no concrete information could be given at the moment.” “We have confirmed the attack, but we cannot give you much information right now. “From the reports we have gotten, most of the passengers have gone into hiding and the officials on board are yet to give us a report of the situation. ”There are reports of gunshots and the train derailed due to the attack.”
