 Former Commander of the Intelligence Response Team, DCP Abba Kyari, alongside his deputy, ACP Sunday Ubua, are alleged to have received a total sum of N4.2bn in their separate bank accounts. This is indicated in a report said to have been sent to the Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, by the National Drug Law and Enforcement Agency. The NDLEA alleged that about N1.4billion passed through Kyari’s account as the commander of the IRT just as it was suspected that Kyari’s deputy, Ubua, may have received about N2.8bn about the same time. The said amounts were reportedly traced to Ubua’s eight bank accounts. Ubua was reported to have received a lump sum of N2.664billion on August 15, 2019. There are speculations that the cash traced to their accounts may be connected to the sale of some illicit substances, including Tramadol worth N3billion. Meanwhile, the NDLEA has written a letter to the AGF seeking his approval for the confiscation of properties and assets belonging to Kyari, who is facing eight counts of conspiracy, obstruction, and dealing in cocaine, and other related offences at the Federal High Court, Abuja. The NDLEA’s request was said to have been dispatched to the justice minister last week following the March 7 arraignment of Kyari and his men for dealing in cocaine. The other defendants in the charge marked FHC/ABJ/57/2022, are four members of the IRT, Ubua, Bawa James, Simon Agirigba and John Nuhu.
