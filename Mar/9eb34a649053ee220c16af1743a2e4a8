 BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO The ancient town of Ede in Osun State has suspended payment of electricity bills over alleged prolonged power outage. This followed a directive by the Federation of Ede Youth Development Association (FEYDA) to the residents of the town to desist from honouring electricity bills from the Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company (IBEDC) till further notice. A statement issued and signed by Comrade Abdulazeez Mufutaudee  Idowu, the National President of the youth association of the town and obtained on Friday, said Ede has been in darkness for couple of months and that residents could no longer continue to pay for the light they didn’t consume. The statement entitled: “Directive for Temporary Suspension of Payment of Electricity Bills in Ede,” revealed that the decision was arrived at at the association’s executive meeting. It read, “Considering the state of electricity in Ẹdẹ for couple of months now in which darkness has ravaged the entire town perpetually, courtesy of IBEDC business hub in Ẹdẹ. In spite of that, their staff are still going around the town with crazy bills for the energy people did not use. “Consequently, FEYDA is now using this medium to urge the residents of Ẹdẹ in both township and cottage feeders to suspend payment of electricity bills forthwith until further notice. “We hope that our people will honour this directive and support our next line of action with their presence by responding to our call.”
