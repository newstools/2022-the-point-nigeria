 BY BENEDICT NWACHUKWU, ABUJA The Abia State Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Dr. Kingsley Ononogbu, has reiterated the party’s resolve to carry all APC members of goodwill along in the affairs of the party. Dr. Ononogbu stated this in Abuja. He emphasized his desire to open multi channels of political alliances which includes reaching out to willing stakeholders of the state across political divide. A statement signed by the state Publicity Secretary, Hon. Okey Ezeala recalled that the state chapter of the All Progressives Congress had shortly after their 2021 elective Congresses in  Abia announced an open door policy of negotiations and grassroots persuasions to oust the 22 year unfortunate grip of PDP and their stooges in Abia polity. Ononogbu further hinted, “most of our politically resourceful persons from Abia have already indicated interest to join the APC in few days to come”. He extended same hand of fellowship to other stakeholders with electoral value to join and  stressed that the APC will never tolerate political treachery and pretenders who would operate as APC members during the day but are PDP members at night. “We therefore urge all Abians of goodwill to  support the LRR project to Liberate, Rescue and Reposition Abia as God’s own State indeed,” he said.
