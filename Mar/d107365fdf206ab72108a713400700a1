 The inhabitants of Elebele, Imiringi, Otuasega and Oruma riverine communities in Kolo Creek Development Cluster Board, Ogbia Local Government Area of Bayelsa State have given the management of Shell Petroleum Development Company 14-day ultimatum to restore power supply in their areas or face their anger. The people were aggrieved that the Anglo-Dutch multinational oil firm failed to intervene despite that they lived without electricity supply for nine years. Shell earlier set December 14, 2021 as commencement date for the delivery of an uninterrupted electricity supply to the communities from its newly installed gas turbine, SPDC Kolo Creek and Oil and Gas Manifold at Imiringi, but the oil company failed to meet up. The communities said that they gave the 14-day ultimatum as the hope of having their demand from the company was dicey. According to the communities, having drawn the battle line with the Anglo-Dutch oil giant, the agreement must be met failing which they threatened to shut down the company’s oil installations in Kolo-Creek at the expiration of the given ultimatum. The ultimatum, jointly signed by the paramount rulers of Imiringi, Otuasega, Oruma, Elebele and other communities, called for the immediate connection of the 2.5 MVA generator installed by Morpol Engineering Services Limited and award of contract for Oruma high tension line. However, the Deputy Governor of Bayelsa State, Senator Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo, during a meeting with community leaders and the executives of the cluster board and other representatives from Otuasega, Elebele, Oruma and Imiringi at his office in Yenagoa, expressed concern on the development. He urged the communities to exercise patience on the issue. The Community Relations Manager, SPDC (East), Evans Krukrubo, said that the company was committed to working with the state government to deliver the project.
