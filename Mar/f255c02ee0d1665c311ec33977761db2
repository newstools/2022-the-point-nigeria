 Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, has indicated that the Second Niger Bridge would be inaugurated in October. The bridge has reportedly gulped over N400 billion. It is expected that with the completion of concrete work on the 1.6 kilometre-long bridge, the minor alignments on the structure would be wrapped up before the end of April. The Chief of Staff to the President, Prof. Ibrahim Gambari, on Tuesday, led a team of senior government officials to inspect the progress of work on the second Niger Bridge that is primed to link major cities in the South-East and South-South with the rest of the country. President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration is anxious to deliver the project. Gambari explained that out of the N400 billion spent, the previous administration committed N10billion. He added that contrary to insinuations, the project was being funded 100 per cent by the Nigerian government. Fashola indicated that there would be power outage around the bridge head for two weeks in April to enable the electricity Transmission Company of Nigeria to relocate and realign the transmission lines to pave the way for the completion of the ring roads connecting the bridge from all routes.
