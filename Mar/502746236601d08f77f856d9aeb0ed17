 BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO Few hours to the National Convention of the ruling All Progressives Congress, a former Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Lasun Yusuff, has dumped the party. It was gathered that Yusuff submitted his resignation from APC at the party’s state secretariat in Osogbo on Friday. The former federal lawmaker has not disclosed his next line of action but there are indications that he may contest Osun gubernatorial election on platform of another party. Yusuff contested for the APC governorship ticket during the February 19 primaries, alongside the incumbent state governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, and Moshood Adeoti, the aspirant backed by Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola.
