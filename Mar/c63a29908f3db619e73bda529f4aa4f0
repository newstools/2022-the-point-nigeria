 Economic and Financial Crimes Commission says former Governor Willie Obiano of Anambra State is currently in its custody undergoing interrogation after his arrest on Thursday. Head of Media and Publicity of EFFC, Wilson Uwujaren, said this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria on Friday in Abuja. He said that Obiano, who was arrested on Thursday at Murtala Mohammed International Airport, Lagos, was brought to Abuja on Friday morning. The EFCC spokesman said that the former governor had not been released, as being speculated in some sections of the media. “The former governor is currently in our custody undergoing interrogation, and I cannot say exactly when he will be released. I don’t know how long the exercise will take. “All I can tell you now is that he is still in EFCC’s custody in Abuja,” he said. Uwujaren, however, said that he was not aware of the arrest of the wife of the former governor, Ebelechukwu Obiano, as being speculated in some sections of the media. Obiano was arrested by EFCC on Thursday night, hours after handing over to the new Anambra State Governor, Chukwuma Soludo. (NAN)
