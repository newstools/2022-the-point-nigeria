 BY AGNES NWORIE, ABAKALIKI A governorship aspirant in Ebonyi State, Sylvester Ogbaga, has pledged to end multiple taxation in the state if elected as governor in the 2023 general elections. Ogbaga, who represents the Izzi/ Abakaliki Federal Constituency at the National Assembly, gave the assurance to the people in Abakaliki shortly after purchasing forms for the governorship position. The aspirant, a member of the People’s Democratic Party, said that his administration would prioritize the welfare of the electorates. Expressing his determination to correct the wrongs of past administrations in the state, he said, “I have taken time to study the problem of Ebonyi. Thank God the governor was able to do some infrastructure, but our problem is not just about infrastructure. “We need to be alive to enjoy the infrastructure. I will bring peace into Ebonyi State; it is lacking, everybody knows it. People die on a daily basis in Ebonyi State, that is not acceptable. Since 2015, there had never been employment into the state civil service; not even one person was employed. Graduates are coming on yearly basis, we need to take care of them. It will boost our economy. “We need to honestly go back to industrialization to create opportunities for people who did not get government job to be gainfully employed. “We have to revisit our tax processes. You don’t tax people when they are still hungry and suffering. Many businesses had been closed down in Ebonyi State. We realized that the Abakpa Market was demolished the month traders were forced to the international market without compensation. Such is not done anywhere. “Yes, we have overhead bridges everywhere but my question is are all the overhead bridges important where they are sited? Is it taking  care of the youths? How many employment opportunities has it created? Look at our ministries, agencies and departments; we shall reorganize them.”
