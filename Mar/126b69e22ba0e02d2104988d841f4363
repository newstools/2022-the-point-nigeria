 BY BENEDICT NWACHUKWU, ABUJA As the National Convention of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) gets underway, the Screening Committee has disqualified two aspirants for the position of National Organizing Secretary of the party. Impeccable sources at the National Secretariat of the party told our reporter that the duo of Ismaeel Ahmed, SA to the President and member of the APC Caretaker Committee,  and Sulieman Argungu, who is also the Chief of Staff to the Kebbi State governor,  were disqualified because they failed to resign from their positions contrary to the Electoral Act 2022. Recall that the party had asked its political appointees not to vote at the convention as stipulated by law. Our source who spoke on the condition of anonymity said; “The Screening Committee had no option than to disqualify them because they failed to comply with the law. For instance, Barr. Ismaeel who is also a member of the Caretaker Committee that is organizing the Convention is also a contestant. That is not proper, hence his disqualification, because he cannot be a judge in his own case.” The leaders of the APC including President Muhammmadu Buhari have been working to have consensus candidates for most of the positions, a development our source said made most stakeholders to indicate interest in becoming members of the incoming National Working Committee (NWC).
