 The Ebonyi State House of Assembly has declared the seats of three of its members who were elected on the platform of the People’s Democratic Party vacant. The affected PDP lawmakers are Ali Okechukwu, Franca Okpo Abakaliki and Victor Aleke. The declaration, on Tuesday, followed a letter of resignation purportedly written by the three lawmakers. Francis Nwifuru, Speaker of the House, read the letter during an emergency sitting of the House. The Federal High Court sitting in Abuja, had in a declaratory judgement, on March 8, sacked the Speaker of the Ebonyi State House of Assembly alongside 15 other lawmakers for defecting from the PDP to the All Progressive  Congress in the state.
