 Four policemen were, on Tuesday evening, feared dead in an accident involving the convoy of the Chief of Staff, Prof. Ibrahim Gambari; Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola; and Chris Ngige, Minister of Labour and Employment. The crash happened during the inspection of the Second Niger Bridge in Asaba, Delta State. The driver reportedly lost control of the vehicle conveying security operatives and crashed into a deep pit. A source, John Okorie, was quoted as saying that the incident happened when the vehicle conveying the victims was negotiating the bend leading to the construction site of the Second Niger Bridge in Asaba. The police vehicle was said to be speeding to meet up with the ministers’ vehicles when it veered off the road and crashed. A Delta Line driver, who spoke to our correspondent on the condition of anonymity, said, “The incident was very fatal. “The policeman driver was speeding and, while negotiating the bend because of the speed, could not control the vehicle. They crashed into a deep pit. I was at the back of the convoy, driving slowly. “With the help of other people, we rescued four of them but they were badly injured. They were shouting as the vehicle fell on them.” The Police Public Relations Officer, Delta State Command, DSP Bright Edafe, said that he had yet to receive the report at press time.
