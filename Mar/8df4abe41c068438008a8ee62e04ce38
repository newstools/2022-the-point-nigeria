 BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO Justice Adepele Ojo of an Osun State High Court sitting in Osogbo, on Wednesday declared that prima facie case had been established against the Hilton Hotel owner, Rahmon Adedoyin and six of his workers arraigned in connection with the death of late Timothy Adegoke, a Master’s student at Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife. Adedoyin, and six others including, Magdalene Chiefuna, Adeniyi Aderogba, Oluwale Lawrence, Oyetunde Kazeem, Adebayo Kunle and Adedeji Adesola had been arraigned on 11 counts bordering on conspiracy, murder, tampering with corpse, altering of receipt and administration of extrajudicial oath among others. The prosecution counsel, Mathew Omosun had prayed the court to dismiss the no case submission of the defence stressing that prema facie had been established based on all evidences presented before the court. Ruling on the no-case submission filed by the defendants, the Osun Chief Judge, said that, going by the exhibits presented by all witnesses, the defendants have case to answer regarding the death and called on them to enter their defence. She ruled, “Giving the circumstances of this case, I am of the respectful view that a prema facie case has been established. It should be noted that this ruling is not a judgement on wether the defendants are guilty or not. The no case submission has been discharged and I hereby call on defendants to enter their defence in the charges against them.” Responding to the ruling, one of the defence counsels, Kehinde Eleja, SAN, told the court that they were not ready to immediately file their defence since they were not sure of what the ruling would be. He then prayed the court that the defence counsels would require time to prepare their defence. Consequently, Justice Ojo adjourned the matter till April 25 for the defense to open their case.
