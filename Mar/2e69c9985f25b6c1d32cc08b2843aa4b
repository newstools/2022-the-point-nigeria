 BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO The management of the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife on Saturday asked its students to embark on a two-week mid-semester break. This came after three days that some aggrieved indigenes of the university host community besieged the campus with charms and other fetish objects in protest against the appointment of Prof Adeboye Bamire as the substantive Vice-Chancellor of the institution. Some workers and students of the institution were said to have been assaulted by the protesters. In a special release dated March 26, 2022 and signed the university Registrar, Mrs M. I. Omosule, a copy of which was obtained by The Point, the break would begin on Monday, March 28. The decision for the break was arrived at a management meeting held on Saturday. “This is to inform staff and students of the University that management, at a meeting held today, Saturday, 26th March, 2022 approved a two-week mid-semester break for students begining from Monday, March 28, 2022. We wish students of the University an enjoyable week,” the release read. Recall that the majority of Universities across the country appeared to have shutdown completely as the Joint Action Committee (JAC) of the Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Universities (SSANU) and Non-Academic Staff Union of Allied and Educational Institutions (NASU) have embarked on a two-week warning strike, starting from Monday. The decision may completely cripple activities in Nigeria public universities considering the ongoing strike of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) and the Nigerian Academic the National Association of Academic Technologists (NAAT). While the leadership of ASUU in OAU had declared an indefinite strike over unpaid Academic Earned Allowance, members of a parallel academic union on the campus, the Congress of University Academics (CONUA) have refused to join the industrial action and had since been teaching students.
