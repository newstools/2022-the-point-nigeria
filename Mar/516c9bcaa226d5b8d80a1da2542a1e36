 Suspected terrorists have allegedly attacked the Gidan Rail Station along the Abuja-Kaduna rail track. The incident, on Tuesday, came hours after a train was attacked leaving some casualties in its trail on Monday night. A senior railway unionist was said to have confirmed the incident, alleging that some suspected terrorists blew a rail track thereby disrupting the movement of a train heading to Abuja. A source said that the terrorists may have planted IEDs on the tracks so as to force the train heading to Abuja from Kaduna to a stop.
