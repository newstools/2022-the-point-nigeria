 Kaduna State Governor, Nasir el-Rufai, has approved the sum of N1,235,000,000 for payment of gratuity and death benefits for the state and local government council retirees and families of deceased beneficiaries. The Executive Secretary, Kaduna State Pension Bureau, Prof. Salamatu Idris Isah, announce this at a press briefing on Monday. Isah, while giving the breakdown of how the money would be paid, said that N1,035,000,000 would be allocated for the payment of the retirees and families of the deceased in the 23 local government councils. She added that it would be the 14th payment schedule under the local government gratuity for retirees and next-of-kins of deceased beneficiaries. According to her, the sum of N200,000,000 would be for the 16th batch of the state gratuity and death benefits in the Defined Benefit Scheme. She explained that the shortlisted names of the beneficiaries of batch 14 of the local government and batch 16 of the state would soon be placed on all its social media handles at the Pension Bureau and other zonal offices of the local government councils. Isah, however, refuted the rumour that seven local government areas had paid all outstanding gratuities and death benefits under the Defined Benefit Schedule, stating that the Bureau only announced that Kudan Local Government was the first to settle its outstanding liability as of 3rd March, 2022. It was indicated that some unverified files were waiting for vetting and certification from the Local Government Auditor General’s Office.
