 Three robbery suspects have been reportedly set ablaze by a mob in Ofuoma community, Ughelli North Local Government Area of Delta State for stealing musical instruments worth millions of naira. The dead suspects were allegedly arrested by some youths early Saturday morning for carting away property belonging to a Disc Jockey in the community. A source in the community said, “One of the suspects was arrested and he confessed. The other two were traced to their hideout and were also arrested. They were burnt alive on the outskirts of the community, along Odovie-Isiokolo Road. “The angry mob refused to hand them over to the police because they might release them and that would cause problem in the community.” Another source was quoted as saying that “I came out in the middle of the night when I saw people running around and upon inquiry, I was informed that three persons suspected to be robbers had been arrested. They said that they were responsible for the missing musical instruments belonging to a popular DJ in the community. “The DJ attempted suicide over a month ago. It took the intervention of family members and friends for him to be alive.” The Police Public Relations Officer in the Command, Bright Edafe, confirmed the incident, saying that the youths failed to hand over the suspects to the police. The incident happened few days after two persons were allegedly set ablaze in a neighbouring community for stealing iron rods from a building site.
