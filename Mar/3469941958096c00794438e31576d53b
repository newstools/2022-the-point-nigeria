 The Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN, has accused politicians of being instrumental to the resurgence of insecurity in the South-East zone of the country. According to the CAN Chairman, Abia State, Apostle Emmanuel Agomuo, politicians who recruited hoodlums for dirty jobs during electioneering and failed to empower them afterwards, should be held responsible for the worsening insecurity in the region. He said that contrary to allegations by security agencies that members of IPOB were behind the development, political thugs were the actual cause. The cleric said that hoodlums had since hijacked the situation in the South-East to unleash mayhem on innocent citizens. He added that the hoodlums had no legitimate means of livelihood, and therefore, take to criminality and terrorism using the arms given to them by those he described as wicked politicians. He said, “I don’t think IPOB is behind this barbarity. These are the bad boys politicians use for election. After using them, they fail to empower them and that is why they go back into criminality. Politicians who recruit these hoodlums are to be held responsible for the mess in the South-East.” He urged security agencies not to be narrow-minded in their efforts to unravel the real sources of the monster but to be open to all possibilities.
