 BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO The Speaker of the Osun State House of Assembly, Hon. Timothy Owoeye has asked the Commissioner of Police in the state, Olawale Olokode to investigate an audio recording circulating on social media alleging his involvement in the cover-up of cult related activities in Ilesa. The Speaker, in a petition to Olokode held that an unknown man suspected to be a Police Officer defamed him by alleging that he reached out to top Police hierarchy in the state to set free a suspected serial killer and cultist. Owoeye in a statement by his Media aide, Mr. Kunle Alabi on Saturday, stated that the said audio has become a source of concern for his family, loved ones and political associates, saying he has worked and lived in Ilesa all his life contributing his quota to the development of the town. The petition to the CP read partly, “I am a proud ijesa man who loves my community and its inhabitants so dearly, I have made so many efforts both overtly and covertly ever since the cult clashes began to make sure Ilesa is a peaceful abode for all and sundry. “Noteworthy is my commitment and support to the Nigeria Police Committee on Cultism ( POCACOV) during their outreaches is to ijesa land. “May I at this point urge you (Olokode) to urgently investigate the audio which is capable of lowering people’s confidence in me. it is also important considering the fact that your name (Olokode) was mentioned and that of our revered monarch (Owa Obokun of Ijesaland, Oba Gabriel Adekunle Aromolaran). “The said officer in the audio where he also disparaged Owa Obokun and the stool of his forebears, alluded to being part of a recent security meeting and as well confirmed that he is a security official.”
