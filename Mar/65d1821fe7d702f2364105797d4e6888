 Nigeria Super Eagles failed to book a ticket to the 2022 Qatar World Cup finals after they were held to a 1-1 draw at the Moshood Abiola Stadium in Abuja, by the Black Stars of Ghana. Ghana therefore proceeds on the away rule goal. Augustine Eguavoen made five changes to the side that drew against the Black Stars in the first leg of the World Cup qualifier at the Baba Yara Stadium, Kumasi on Friday. Ghana, against the run of play, surprisingly opened scoring on the 11th minute when Thomas Partey of Arsenal lashed into a loose ball from outside the box which best goalkeeper Uzoho hands down. Super Eagles captain, William Troost-Ekong equalised for the home team in the 22nd minute from the penalty apot that was awarded after a VAR review. Victor Osinmhen made it 2-1 but had the goal ruled offside in the 35th minute after another VAR check. The Nigeria side lost steam and became uncoordinated as the players put almost every step wrong. The Ghanaians sat deep and defended vigorously with occasional counter attack and comfortably saw the game out. While Ghana fans were celebrating the qualification, disappointed Nigeria fans expressed their frustration by throwing plastic bottles on the pitch.
