 The Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba, has ordered the evacuation of impounded vehicles and unregistered exhibit from police stations across the country. The acting Force Public Relations Officer, CSP Olumuyiwa Adejobi, made this known in a statement on Tuesday, in Abuja. The statement quoted Adejobi as saying that the order followed the unprofessional manner the vehicles were stacked within police facilities. It read that the I-G expressed dissatisfaction over the stockpiling of vehicles recovered from crime scenes or those whose ownership were being contested. The statement read in parts that ”The act will no longer be tolerated as it is tantamount to gross abuse of administrative and judicial processes.” It stated that the I-G had directed the divisional police officers to carry out evaluation and release the vehicles on bond to their owners. It further read that the decongestion of police stations and facilities nationwide would be of great operational advantage to the police to effectively deliver their responsibilities. (NAN).
