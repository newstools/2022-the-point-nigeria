 The National President, Parents Teachers Association, Danjuma Haruna, has urged the Federal Government to further dialogue with the Academic Staff Union of Universities in a bid to resolve their disagreement. Haruna spoke on Monday in Kaduna during an interactive session with journalists. He said that students and lecturers needed to return to school, adding that not all parents could afford sending their children abroad or to private universities. According to him, the strike came amidst the increase in the prices of foodstuffs and fuel and the security challenges facing the country “We don’t want our children to spend three months at home because of strike. “We are begging the Federal Government, as a matter of urgency, to go back and resolve issues with ASUU,” he said. Haruna appealed to ASUU to have a rethink on the issues just as he urged the Federal Government to listen to the demands of the lecturers to save students from time wasting. The PTA national president also asked the Federal Government to secure the release of all the abducted students still being held by bandits and other terror groups. He also called for the protection of all boarding schools in a bid to halt activities of bandits, Boko Haram and kidnappers. (NAN).
