 Adams Oshiomhole, former National Chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress, has debunked the rumour doing the rounds that he aspires to run for president in the coming general elections. Oshiomole spoke in reaction to social media reports regarding his alleged interest in the presidency. The former Edo State governor said that if he decided to run for any office, he would speak directly to Nigerians. Social media invites were sent to some journalists and stakeholders on Friday morning asking them to attend Oshiomhole’s presidential declaration at the Federal Capital Territory FCT Council for Arts and Culture at Area 10, Abuja. Major streets of Abuja were also dotted with presidential posters of the former labour leader. Some of his supporters had thronged the venue only to be told that the event would no longer hold. Oshiomhole was quoted in a report as saying that “It must be a mistake. I will not declare on the pages of newspapers. If I will declare, it will be to the people.”
