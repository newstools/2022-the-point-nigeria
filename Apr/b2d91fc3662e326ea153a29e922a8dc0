 The All Progressives Congress has said that the money that was stolen at the national secretariat of the party does not belong to the APC. The National Publicity Secretary of the ruling party, Felix Morka, made the disclosure in a statement which he signed on Thursday. He was quoted in the statement as saying that the money is not the proceeds from the sale of nomination and expression of interest forms. On Wednesday, a theft of about $75,000 was reported at the APC national secretariat. Morka’s statement read that “On Wednesday, April 27, 2022, a sum of $50,000 was reported lost by an individual around the entrance gate of the National Secretariat of the party. “To be clear, the lost money does not belong to the party. In any event, the fee for the said forms is set and denominated in Naira not US Dollars. “The loss is neither connected with proceeds of sale of forms nor with relocation of the venue for the collection of Expression of Interest and Nomination Forms from the secretariat grounds to the International Conference Centre.” It added that the party’s decision to relocate the venue for collection of forms to the International Conference Center in Abuja was to ease human and vehicular movements around the secretariat. The statement further read that “As widely advertised and reported in major news outlets, all purchases of forms are payable to designated bank accounts of the party.”
