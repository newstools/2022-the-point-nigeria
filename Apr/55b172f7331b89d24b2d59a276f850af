 Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State has mourned the passing of the Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi, who joined his ancestors on Friday. Oba Adeyemi was reported to have passed on at the Afe Babalola University Teaching Hospital, Ado Ekiti, at the age of 82. Alaafin reigned for 52 years on the throne of his forebears. In a statement on Saturday by Governor Abiodun’s Chief Press Secretary, Kunle Somorin, the governor described the monarch’s death as a tragic and occurred when least expected. “I commiserate with the Oyomesi,  the wives and children of the late monarch and the entire Adeyemi family over this irreplaceable loss. I pray for their comfort and peace at the trying times. “It is unfortunate that Kabiyesi had to take his leave of us, at this period, when we need his wisdom the most, as we approach the 2023 general elections, a critical period in our political landmarks”,  Somorin quoted the governor as saying. Governor Abiodun, the statement further explained that the death of Oba Adeyemi has created a huge vacuum in the traditional and historical societies, saying that “his death is also a great loss because Nigeria will miss the services of a great reservoir of knowledge and historical narrations. Governor Abiodun noted that Alaafin’s death will create a huge vacuum in the entire Yorubaland, while his sagacious and royal counsel will be sorely missed Abiodun, who described the late monarch as a quintessential traditional ruler, custodian and exemplar of Yoruba culture and tradition, said that posterity and history will remember Oba Adeyemi’s service and dedication to the Yorubaland, and immense contributions to ensure peace and unity in the country. Abiodun prayed God grants the departed monarch eternal rest and rewards him with Aljannah Firdaus.
