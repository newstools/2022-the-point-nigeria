 Nnamdi Kanu, the detained leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra, has filed a fresh N50billion suit against the Federal Government. The action was said to have been taken in view of his alleged ‘abduction’ from Kenya to Nigeria for trial. Kanu insisted that the arrest violated his fundamental human rights. In the suit filed through his team of lawyers, led by Chief Mike Ozekhome, SAN, Kanu queried the basis of his arrest. Among others, his counsels prayed the court to determine, “Whether the way and manner in which the Plaintiff was abducted in Kenya and extraordinarily renditioned to Nigeria is consistent with extant laws particularly the provisions of Article 12 (4) of the African charter on human and people’s rights (ratification and enforcement) Act, Cap A9 laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004, and article/part 5 (a) of the African charter’s principles and guidelines on human and peoples’ rights while countering terrorism in Africa. “Whether by the operation of Section 15 of the extradition Act, Cap e25, laws of the federation of Nigeria 2004, the plaintiff can be competently/legally tried for offences stated in counts 1 to 14 of the 15-count amended charge in charge number fhc/abj/cr/383/2015 between Federal Republic of Nigeria versus Nnamdi Kanu, which are not the offences for which he was surrendered or extraordinarily renditioned to Nigeria. “Whether by the operation of Section 15 of the extradition Act, Cap e25, laws of the federation of Nigeria 2004, the defendants have the enabling powers to detain the plaintiff or subject him to be tried on charges later amended after he was extraordinarily renditioned to Nigeria.”
