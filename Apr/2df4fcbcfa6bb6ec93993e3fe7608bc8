 The Managing Director of the Bank of Agriculture, Alwan Ali-Hassan, who was abducted nine days ago, has regained his freedom from captivity. Ali-Hassan was kidnapped on March 28 by bandits who bombed the Abuja-Kaduna train with over 362 passengers on board. A senior official of the bank was quoted as saying that Ali-Hassan regained his freedom today (Wednesday). While keeping silent on the amount that was paid as ransom to the abductors, the official of the bank expressed gratitude to God for his release. “We are grateful to God for his release and we pray never to witness this. We also pray others get released soon,” he said.
