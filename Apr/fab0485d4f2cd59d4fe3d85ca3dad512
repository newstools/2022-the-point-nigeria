 PAN Nigeria Limited, having parted ways with Automobile Peugeot of France early this year, has crossed the production line of 500,000 vehicles. The automobile manufacturing company, based in Kaduna, moved into multi-brand auto production with a total of 523,000 vehicles during its 47 years alliance with Automobile Peugeot. PAN Nigeria is rated as the only automobile maker in Nigeria to have crossed the half a million production mark. Currently, PAN Nigeria stated that it is channelling its experience towards the production of other reputable brands like Higer and Chery, two Chinese leading auto manufacturing brands. It was gathered that the two Chinese automobile brands offered a wide range of products to PAN Nigeria. A source was quoted as saying that “While Higer is a leading producer of pick-ups and buses, Chery is renown for the production of passenger cars and Sport Utility Vehicles.” The source stated that the “divorce between the two companies was peaceful as none took the other to court. “We are now concentrating on the production of whole range of vehicles from sedan to Sport Utility Vehicles and buses which, in the long run, would benefit our customers across the country.” The source said that PAN Nigeria went for the best brand, stressing that it applied its experience in the auto industry spanning almost five decades to secure quality brands that meet the needs of their customers who trusted their judgement to deliver the right and quality products that march their tastes in every segment. With this, PAN has transformed from a mono to multi brand auto manufacturers in Nigeria. It would be recalled that the PAN ruled the Nigeria automobile space in the 70s and 80s with models such as Peugeot 404, 504, 505 range.
