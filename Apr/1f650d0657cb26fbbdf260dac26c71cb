 The Corporate Affairs Commission says that the Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Otunba Adeniyi Adebayo, has approved the Insolvency Regulations 2022. This is contained in a statement signed by Rasheed Mahe, CAC’s Head, Media Unit on Sunday in Abuja. The statement quoted Mahe as saying that the approval was in line with the powers conferred on the Minister by Section 867 of the Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA) 2020. It read that the IR would, henceforth, regulate insolvency proceedings under CAMA. The News Agency of Nigeria reports that insolvency is a situation in which an individual, or company cannot pay off bills and debts. Stating that a person is insolvent when the total liabilities exceed total assets, it listed the proceedings as Company Voluntary Arrangements, Administration of Companies, Receivership/Managership, Winding-up by the Court, and Creditors’ Voluntary Winding-up. Others include Arrangements and Compromise, Netting, and Dissolution of Incorporated Trustees. The statement added that the IR would not apply to rules of the courts relating to insolvency applications made by the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court. It would also not apply to a court designated by an Act of the National Assembly as being vested with jurisdiction to hear cases arising out of CAMA. (NAN).
