 Some bandits have reportedly killed three residents and abducted 10 others in an attack on the Sabo GRA on the outskirts of the Kaduna metropolis. Six people were said to have suffered varying degrees of injury in the incident. The bandits allegedly stormed the community in large number as the residents were about to watch the 9 o’clock news on TV. One of the residents, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said, “We are in deep trouble in this community. This is about the fourth time our community is being invaded by these bandits. “They came around 8:30pm and started shooting. Some people were able to run to Sabo for safety. They killed three people and injured six others. “I don’t know how many people they kidnapped, but I can confirm that I know of 10 people that were taken. “Many people who escaped from their homes were yet to come back, so it is difficult to determine the exact number of people that were kidnapped. “Throughout last night residents did not sleep as they were afraid. “We were helpless; everybody was tensed and agitated. We were at the mercy of the bandits because they were many and they were carrying sophisticated weapons.” The police have yet to confirm the incident.
