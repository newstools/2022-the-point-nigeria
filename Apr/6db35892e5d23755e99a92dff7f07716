It urged Christians and all Nigerians to use the occasion to pray for an end to insecurity in the country. The statement read, “Security is everybody’s business. I, therefore, urge Nigerians and foreigners resident in our country to display a high sense of citizenship and public spiritedness at this critical time in the history of our country by supporting the efforts of all security agencies in bringing peace and security of lives and property of the citizenry.”
