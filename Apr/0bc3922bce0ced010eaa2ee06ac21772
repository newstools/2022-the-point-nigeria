 President Muhammadu Buhari has condoled with the government and people of Kenya over the death of former President Mwai Kibaki. Kibaki was the country’s first opposition President. Reacting to Kibaki’s death on Saturday, President Buhari said that “The late Kibaki had set a remarkable record of being the first opposition politician to end 40 years of one-party rule by being elected president in 2013. “Kibaki had demonstrated that with patience and tenacity, a man can achieve his ultimate goal in life. “Someone else would have given up the struggle after a few years, but Kibaki had stayed the course and ended 40 years of one-party rule. “This is a record that we can’t forget and for which posterity and history would continue to remember the late Kenyan President.”
