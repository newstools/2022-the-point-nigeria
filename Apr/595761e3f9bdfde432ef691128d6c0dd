 BY BAMIDELE FAMOOFO The Board of Directors of African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank) approved the launch of the Ukraine Crisis Adjustment Trade Financing Programme for Africa (UKAFPA), a programme of credit facilities that the Bank has developed to manage the impacts of the Ukraine crisis on African economies and businesses. The programme amounts to US$ 4 billion. The Bank noted that the Russia-Ukraine crisis which escalated on 24 February 2022 has had a significant effect on the global economy and given the importance of both Russia and Ukraine as sources of crude oil and gas, raw materials and grains, the outbreak of the conflict has wider repercussions on a global scale, including adversely affecting African economies, especially those that rely heavily on grain, fertilizer and fuel imports. Professor Benedict Oramah, President and Chairman of the Board of Directors of Afreximbank commented the approval of the programme by the Board demonstrates their responsiveness to the needs of African member states and their citizens as the initiative will contribute immensely to averting social anxiety and upheaval that may arise from looming food shortages and high costs of fertilizer and petroleum products. The UKAFPA programme is focused on import Re-Order Cost Adjustment Financing, to help countries to meet immediate import price increases pending domestic demand adjustments, Oil and Metals Buy-Back Financing to refinance over-collateralized loans in the context of the current high oil and metal prices, and thereby release freer cashflow for use in meeting other urgent needs, eg. food and fertilizer imports and servicing rising cost of debt, Commodity Export Revenue Stabilisation to help countries and companies to structure and enter derivative contracts at today’s high commodity prices and stabilise future export earnings, Tourism Revenue Deficit Financing to be extended to Central Banks of tourism dependent economies to cover foreign exchange revenue shortfalls arising from a decline in tourism arrivals from Russia and Ukraine and National Export Revenue Acceleration Facility to be used to accelerate the completion of impactful export-oriented projects by expediting access to foreign currency for use in importing critical equipment, technology, and expertise, for project completion. UKAFPA, according to Afreximbank, is a response to an urgent call for emergency intervention by member states of the Bank. “UKAFPA – compliant financing requests received from across Africa already exceeds US$15 billion. There is some urgency to meet these requests to avoid catastrophic social conditions across Africa and reduce the risk of their morphing into political challenges,” The Bank disclosed.
