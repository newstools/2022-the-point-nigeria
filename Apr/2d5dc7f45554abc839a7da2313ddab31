 President Muhammadu Buhari has mourned the tragic and unfortunate death of two officers in a Nigerian Air Force plane crash in Kaduna. Reacting to the death of Flight Lieutenant Abubakar Alkali and Flight Lieutenant Elijah Haruna Karatu, the President said, “I am shocked beyond words by the demise of these two promising young men who risked their lives in the service of the country. “There is no reward big enough to pay for the services of these young and dedicated professional airmen in the service of their country.” While extending his sympathies to the Chief of Air Staff and the families of the deceased, President Buhari called for “more safety measures to forestall tragic incidents of this kind.” “I welcome the decision by the NAF  authorities to investigate this accident, but I also call on them to publish and implement the recommendations of the reports of past investigations into air accidents, with a view to preventing future tragedies and putting closure to the families and friends of the deceased,” the President added.
