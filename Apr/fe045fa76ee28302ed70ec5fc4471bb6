 Some yet-to-be-identified gunmen, suspected to be kidnappers, reportedly abducted four family members in Shadadi community in Kuje Area Council, Federal Capital Territory. The residents of the community told the News Agency of Nigeria, on Wednesday, in Abuja that the incident happened around 1am during the hoodlums’ attack. One of the relatives of the victims, who preferred anonymity, told NAN that the kidnappers, numbering about 10 and shooting sporadically into the air, forced their way into the house by pulling down one of the burglar proofs on the window. He said, “Immediately they entered at about 1am, they told everybody in the house to lie down with each of them pointing their guns on each member of the family. “The next thing they did was that they demanded for a bag in the house and when one of the family members brought the bag, they rejected it and demanded for a particular one. “The family member went inside the room and brought another bag that they accepted. They abducted the husband, one of his daughters, his brother and his sister-in-law.” A resident of the community named Joy Adogo, expressed shock over the incident. She said that several of the abductors were all over the environment while about 10 were inside the house. “They were numbering about 30 when I saw them going through my window and it was not actually a good experience. “My appeal is for the police to step in to ensure their safe release.” The Police Public Relations Officer in the Federal Capital Territory, DSP Josephine Adeh, said that she had not been briefed.
