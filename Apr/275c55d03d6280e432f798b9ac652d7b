 A former Head of Electrical Engineering Department, Kaduna Polytechnic, Ramatu Abarshi; alongside her daughter, Amira; and a commercial driver, have been reportedly kidnapped along the Kaduna-Kachia Road. It was learnt that Abarshi and Amira were on their way from Mariri village in Kajuru Local Government Area of the state where they went to distribute relief materials and Sallah clothing to children orphaned by banditry. A lecturer in the Polytechnic, who confirmed their abduction, said that the bandits attacked them around Kasuwan Magani on Saturday evening. The lecturer said, “Engineer Ramatu Abarshi and her daughter, Amira were returning to Kaduna after a visit to Mariri village in Kajuru Local Government where they distributed household items to the less privileged.
