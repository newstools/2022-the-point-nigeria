 Oyo State Governor, ‘Seyi Makinde, has felicitated Christians across the State and Nigeria on the occasion of this year’s Easter, urging them to imbibe the lessons of love, sacrificial living and peaceful co-existence. According to him, those were the values Jesus Christ taught the world through his death and resurrection. The governor, in an Easter message signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Taiwo Adisa, charged Christians to use the important period to pray for the continued progress of Oyo State and for peace and security across the state and Nigeria as a nation. The governor stated that prayers of God’s people remained an important ingredient to sustaining the peace and prosperity being witnessed in the state. He said: “I felicitate our brethren in Christ across Oyo State and all over Nigeria on the important occasion marking the death and resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ. “Easter Season has always been a moment for sober reflections; a period for Christians to re-evaluate their stand in the Lord and a moment to relive the lessons inherent in the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. “These lessons, ranging from love, to sacrificial living and selflessness form the very core of the Christian faith and they must always reflect in our daily lives. “But as God would have it, He seems to be emphasising another important lesson on peaceful and harmonious co-existence, as the Easter season, again, coincides with the holy month of Ramadan. So, this is another indication that our harmonious co-existence is approved by God. “It is as if God is saying to us all again, love your neighbour as yourself. “As we go about celebrating Easter, I pray that the joys of the season fill our lives.”
