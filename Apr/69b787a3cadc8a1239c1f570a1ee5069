 Hearing of an appeal filed by the Lambo branch of Lasunwon Ruling House in Ikorodu, Lagos State, challenging the installation of Oba Kabir Shotobi as the Ayangburen has been fixed for November 9 by the Appeal Court sitting in Lagos. Justice Obande Ogbuinya granted the appellants’ motion for extension of time to file an amended document and adjourned the matter for hearing. The court also premised the adjournment on the non appearance of the second counsel. Lead counsel to the appellants, Eyitayo Jegede, SAN, presented a Memorandum of Appearance to the court. Recall that Kabiru Shotobi was installed as the Odofin of Ikorodu officially in 2009. He held the office from 2009 till 2015 when Justice M. A. Savage’s judgement ignored the consent judgement of Justice H. A. O. Abiru of the Lagos High Court, Ikorodu Division. The judgment of the High Court, Ikorodu, in Suit No. IKD/57/2007 stated that the respondents are not bound by the consent judgment in suit Number IKD/57/2007 wherein it was agreed that the next chieftaincy that comes to the Lasuwon Ruling House of Ikorodu is conceded to the Lambo branch by the Adegorushen branch of which Kabiru Shotobi (the third respondent) is a member. The third respondent, who benefited from the consent judgment to become the Odofin of Ikorodu, consequently reneged to become the Oba.
