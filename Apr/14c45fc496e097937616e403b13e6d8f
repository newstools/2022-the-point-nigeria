 BY AGNES NWORIE, ABAKALIKI The Ministry of Health in Ebonyi State has denied the alleged award of N18billion contract for the projects of six district hospitals in the state. The Commissioner for Health in the state, Dr Daniel Umuzuruike, made the disclaimer in a statement issued in Abakaliki, the state capital on Tuesday. The statement read that the contact was awarded through the procurement council and not via the ministry as alleged by some elements. It warned the public to be mindful of who they transact businesses with in order to avoid falling prey to scammers. The statement read in parts that “It has come to my notice that some scammers are using my name to defraud unsuspecting people by claiming that we are giving contract for the construction of six district hospitals in Ebonyi State at the cost of N18billion only. “I want to state that contracts of such thresholds are usually handled by the state procurement council and not at ministerial level.  Also, there must be an advert in national dailies or e-procurement of such projects calling for tenders. Furthermore, we don’t operate district hospitals system in Ebonyi State. “On this note, I want to warn that anyone dealing with any person or group of people without going through the normal processes of Ministry of Health, Ebonyi State is doing that at his/her own risk and I disassociate myself and Ebonyi State Ministry of Health from such deals. “The general public is to, therefore, note that I do not give contracts or have agents anywhere working for me or the Ebonyi State Ministry of Health.”
