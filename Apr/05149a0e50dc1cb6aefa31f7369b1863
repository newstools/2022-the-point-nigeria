Charges Igbos to invest in South-East  BY AGNES NWORIE, ABAKALIKI A socio-political group called Prayer Network for Good Governance has joined the call for the Igbo presidency in 2023 for equity sake. Briefing journalists in Abakaliki, Ebonyi State, on Sunday, the group said that in the interest of equity, major political parties in Nigeria should zone Presidential position to the South-East. The National Coordinator of the group, Albert Chukwuma, stressed the need to promote equity, fairness and good governance among the federating units in the country. He frowned on the deteriorating security situation in the land and urged the Federal Government to find urgent solution to curb the menace. “This is a political platform that is interested in good governance in Nigeria. It is not owned by any political party. Our aim is to provide advocacy for good governance, not to fight any government. We work as voice of the voiceless. We call on all major political parties in the country to zone Presidency to South-East. We also call on NASS to revisit the gender equality bill.” On his part, the newly inaugurated Ebonyi State Coordinator of the group, Gregory Esheya, described the continued detention of the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kalu, as unfair. Gregory noted that insecurity was rooted in bottled anger occasioned by agitation against bad governance and call for the unconditional release of Nnamdi Kalu. The State Coordinator of the group enjoined voters to get their permanent voters card in readiness for the election while encouraging Igbos to reverse the trend of developing other cities at the expense of their homelands. Noting that all the problems besetting the country could not be solved by the leadership alone, he solicited for the revival of the Igbo cultural values, language and dressing codes among others.
