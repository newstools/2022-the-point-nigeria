 Former AC Milan forward and current Liberia President George Weah proved that he is still in great shape with his striking abilities as he netted a wonderful goal on a set piece during an exhibition game in Monrovia, at the weekend. The 1995 France Football Ballon d’Or winner and the only African player in history to do so invited some of the greatest African players for a legends game as part of activities to commission a newly constructed ‘Invincible Park’. Jay-Jay Okocha, Emmanuel Adebayor, Asamoah Gyan, El Hadji Diouf and many others are among the African football greats who travelled to Liberia’s main city. During the game, George Weah wore himself the armband for his team and took his responsibilities when a free-kick was granted to his side. The former AS Monaco scorer passed the ball for a teammate and instantly shot it in to the top corner of the goal in a brilliant way despite his age of 55 years.
