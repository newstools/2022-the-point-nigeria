 BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO The Bishop, Catholic Diocese of Oyo, Most Rev Emmanuel Badejo has felicitated with Muslim faithful on the commencement of this year’s Ramadan fast with a charge on them to make their fasting and prayer facilitate a better Nigeria. Badejo, in a message co-signed by Rev Fr Moses Alaba, Director, Interreligious Dialogue of the Diocese, on Saturday, urged Muslims not to relent in their collective effort, prayers and personal relationship with God especially in this Holy season. He said, “Dear brothers and sisters in Islam, on behalf of the clergy, consecrated persons and lay faithful of the Catholic Diocese of Oyo, we wish to felicitate with you, our beloved brothers and sisters as you begin to observe one of the important pillars of Islam, the Ramadan fast. The Almighty Allah, who grants every good thing, must have a hand in the coincidence that you’re beginning this unique spiritual exercise while Christians are still observing their annual fasting which we started a month ago. “We thank God for protecting our lives and again for limiting the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic in the world and on our dear country Nigeria. We equally implore Almighty God to grant us peace and justice in our world. May He continue to guide and guard us all.  Amen “As Muslims and Christians, we must not relent in our collective effort, prayers and personal relationship with God especially in this Holy season. Let our fasting and prayer make us to work for a better Nigeria that we all desire. “As Catholics, we are always ready and willing to work with you for unity, justice and good relationship. Beloved, Nigeria is our own, our common heritage, and country, let us seek for her unity, political stability, equity, true and good governance as we prepare earnestly for general elections early next year. Wishing you a fruitful and blessed month of Ramadan. Ramadan Kareem!!! Ma Salaam!”
