 Vice-President Kamala Harris of United States of America has reportedly tested positive for COVID-19. Harris was said to have returned from a weeklong trip to California. She was, however, said to be asymptomatic. Harris tweeted on Tuesday afternoon that “Today, I tested positive for COVID-19. I have no symptoms, and I will continue to isolate and follow CDC guidelines. I’m grateful to be both vaccinated and boosted.” Kirsten Allen, press secretary to the vice-president said in an earlier statement that Harris tested positive for the virus on rapid and PCR tests. Harris, she said, “will isolate and continue to work from the vice president’s residence. “She has not been a close contact to the President or First Lady due to their respective recent travel schedules. She will follow CDC guidelines and the advice of her physicians. The Vice President will return to the White House when she tests negative.” Harris was scheduled to receive her intelligence briefing on Tuesday at the White House alongside President Joe Biden, according to daily guidance sent to reporters Monday evening. She did not participate in any event or meeting at the White House on Tuesday.
