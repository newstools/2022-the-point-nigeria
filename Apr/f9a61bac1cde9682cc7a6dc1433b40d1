 There was tension at the Federal High Court sitting in Abuja today (Wednesday) as the judge put on hold the judgment on the defection of the Cross River State governor, Ben Ayade, from the People’s Democratic Party to the All Progressives Congress. The judgment was said to have been put on hold following a letter by Mike Ozekhome (SAN), counsel to the governor, who drew the attention of the court to the ruling of a Court of Appeal in Enugu. The judge asked the counsel in the suit to address him on the implications of the appellate court’s judgment on Ayade’s case. As of the time of filing this report, Emmanuel Ukala of the PDP, who instituted the case against Ayade, was addressing the court. Justice Taiwo Oladipupo Taiwo also ordered Ozekhome to make a case for Ayade while lawyer to the Independent National Electoral Commission would follow. Hope is dicey on whether the judge would deliver the judgment today after being addressed by the lawyers or not.
