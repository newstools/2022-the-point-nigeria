 The Redeemed Christian Church of God has sanctioned Leke Adeboye, son of the General Overseer of the church, Pastor Enoch Adeboye, for calling some pastors in the ministry goats. Recall that Leke described some pastors of the church as ‘goats’ for daring to preach after his father had delivered a sermon last Sunday. The parishes of the church were not expected to deliver any other sermon on first Sundays of the month after the General Overseer might have done so via a live broadcast. Leke’s comment had generated anger with many asking RCCG to take disciplinary measures against him. Leke apologised for his comment in a statement posted on his verified Instagram account on Thursday. The statement titled, ‘My Sincere Apology’, read, “I wish to use this medium to tender my unreserved apologies on the statement made from my social media handle about some of our esteemed Pastors. “The disciplinary measures taken by the mission is well received and this period will be used to reflect and introspect. “I wish to crave your indulgence to please forgive my extreme statement which I wish to emphasise was absolutely not intended to insult or malign. “I also wish to apologise profusely to the entire leadership and Pastors of our beloved Church who might have been hurt by this statement. “I remain humbly yours in God’s love and mercies. Yours in His service, Leke Adeboye.”
