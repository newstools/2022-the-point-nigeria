 At least, two officers of the Nigerian Airforce were feared dead on Tuesday as a military aircraft belonging to NAF reportedly crashed in Kaduna State. The casualties were said to be pilots who were onboard the ill-fated aircraft. A source was quoted as saying that the incident occurred “some hours ago. “An Air Force plane has crashed with two pilots feared dead. The plane was flying from Kaduna to Abuja.” The cause of the crash had yet to be known as of the time of filing this report. The NAF Director of Public Relations, Air Commodore Edward Gabkwet, could not be reached as of the time of filing this report. Recall that on July 18, 2021, a NAF fighter plane on a mission in the North-West crashed. The military confirmed the mishap in a statement a day after.
