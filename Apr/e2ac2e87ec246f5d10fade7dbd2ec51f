 Governor Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto State has said that the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, deserves a mayor and better recognition. Tambuwal, who is one of the Peoples Democratic Party presidential aspirants, stated this while meeting with the PDP FCT delegates in Abuja. He said that if elected president, he would give better recognition to the FCT indigenes and their plights. “I believe that there is a lot of work to be done in the FCT. I believe more that the people we met at the FCT deserve more recognition. “I am not insisting that FCT should be a state but you appoint ministers, sometimes two from a state. What stops you from appointing a zonal Minister from the FCT because FCT is part of North-Central zone? “So, if you are appointing an FCT person as Minister to represent the zone, what is wrong with that? “Because of the special nature of FCT, there should be a Mayor in the FCT. In major cities in the world: London, California, they have mayors. “I understand what the issues are, so what is important is for you to work with us on this campaign train. This is a project to beat in the PDP,” Tambuwal said. (NAN).
