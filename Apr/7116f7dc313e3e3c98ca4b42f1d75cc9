 Ogun State governor, Dapo Abiodun, has felicitated Muslim Umah in the country in general and Ogun in particular, on the beginning of fasting in the Holy Month of Ramadan. Abiodun, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Kunle Somorin, on Saturday, described month Ramadan as one with abundant mercy of Allah, acceptance of prayers and forgiveness, calling on the faithful to use the opportunity to pray for the nation and the state. He said the Holy Month with its attendant virtues should serve as a guide, moral and spiritual compass for the Muslims, urging them to uphold the tenets of Ramadan. Abiodun, who stated that the country is passing through various challenges, said Muslims should endeavour to supplicate before Allah in order for Nigeria to overcome the socioeconomic and security obstacles. He added that as the month demands the faithful to engage in doing more good deeds and giving to the needy, the governor charged Muslims to be their brother’s keepers and extend love to the less privileged. While praying Allah to make the fasting easy and less-stressful for the Muslim Umah, Abiodun also pray that the fasting will be accepted as act of worship by Allah.
