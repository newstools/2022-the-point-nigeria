He was sleeping in the room with his elder siblings when the fire started. “The fire got to their house and there was nobody to help them. People thought that their mother was around not knowing that she was not sleeping with them. “The eldest child, who is about seven years, jumped out of the room through the window because their mother locked the door outside while she was leaving the house late at night. “When the eldest jumped out, the other son, who is about five years, tried to jump and the one that was already outside held his hand and pulled him out. There was no way for them to go back to help the two-year-old boy.”
