 Cristiano Ronaldo delivered Manchester United once again as he bagged a hat-trick to help the Red Devils claim all three points against Norwich in the English Premier League at the weekend. A lovely finish, a header and a free-kick, Ronaldo put down a five-star performance against the Canaries. The 37-year old has now scored 21 goals and provided 3 assists in 35 appearances across all competitions so far this season. Speaking after the game, CR7 expressed delight not only because of his 60th career hat-trick, but also for being able to help the team. “Very happy with this win and for getting us back on track in the Premier League,” Ronaldo said. “Like I said before, individual achievements are only worth it when they help us reach our goals as a team, and the 60th hat-trick in my career is so much more important because it brought us the 3 points. “Well done, lads, tremendous effort from everyone. We’re not giving up, we’re fighting until the end!”
