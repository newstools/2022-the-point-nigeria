 Abuja-based socialite and billionaire businessman, Obi Cubana, has reportedly indicated his plan to support some of his secondary school classmates with the sum of N40million. Cubana spoke while hosting his classmates to a reunion party tagged, ‘DMGS C92 reunion,’ 30 years after passing out from secondary school at his Abuja residence. The popular hotelier pledged to support 20 of his former classmates with N2million each while also urging others who are financially buoyant to replicate the gesture. Obi Cubana proposed a trust fund, saying, “Life is not just about taking pictures and posting on Instagram. I mean, many people think that we have made it in life. People are going through hell and to the glory of God, some of us, God has actually blessed us. “I want to propose something tonight. I want us C92 to do something significant tonight. I want us to set up a fund that will cater, that will take care of some of our classmates who are not well to do. “I will support this noble cause by picking up 20 people. When you identify these 20 people from the poorest and the poor amongst us, I want to give them N2million. “Don’t be intimidated by anything. We are not giving because we have, but we are giving because God has enabled us to do so. Whatever you have, no matter how little you think it may be, please be encouraged to participate in this noble course. And, if you have more than me, also contribute accordingly.” While sharing photos with his secondary school classmates on Instagram, Obi Cubana wrote, “My secondary school classmates are here!!
