 Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State has felicitated Christian faithful in the state over the Easter celebration and urged them to use the celebration to pray for Nigeria in general and Ogun in particular. The governor, who noted that Easter is one of the celebrations which signifies and renews hope in mankind, said the best way to celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ is for the Christian faithful to imbibe and live the teachings of Jesus Abiodun, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Kunle Somorin, on Saturday, said the greatest sacrifice Christ made and his resurrection should serve as an assurance that there is hope that the country will surmount its present challenges. While calling on the people to see the Easter period as not only for celebration of triumph of Christ over death, but a period of sober reflection, particularly, at this moment the nation is facing insecurity and economic downturn, the governor, enjoined them to celebrate moderately. He also urged them to be their brothers’ keepers and share with those who don’t have, noting the essence of the celebration is to show love and be good neighbours. Abiodun added though the greater love had been demonstrated to mankind by Jesus who sacrificed died to give life to the world, spreading of love by the Christian faithful during Easter will be reliving love Christ preached while on earth. The governor, therefore, assured that his administration will continue to work to ensure the state is safe and attractive to investors, submitting that Ogun residents will always be centrepiece of his administration’s policies and programmes.
