 David Mark, former Nigerian Senate President, has tasked the citizens to remain resolute in their desire to reverse the ills in the land in a bid to save the country from the precipice. Mark, who bemoaned what he described as the unabating loss of lives, the socio-economic malaise and political uncertainty, said that “The nation arguably faces an uncertain future.” A statement by his Media Adviser, Paul Mumeh, to commemorate Easter celebration, read, “It’s a disservice to humanity to pay lip service to the challenges or pretend that all is well when the socio-economic and political life of the nation is almost in comatose.” It stated that every right thinking member of the society should be worried about the state of the nation and twist of events, adding, “We need to pause and ponder about the state of the nation and find solution going forward. “It is not the exclusive preserve of government to find solutions to our challenges. It is not about political party, religious or ethnic affiliations but about the survival of our nation. “Those in positions of authority should be honest enough to admit that things are wrong and be prepared to lead the way towards finding solutions. I believe we can fix Nigeria again if we resolve to work together in an atmosphere of honesty and mutual respect for one another.”
