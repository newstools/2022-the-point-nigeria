 Some unidentified gunmen were said to have killed 14 Christians, including women and children, in Benue State on Monday night. According to a US-based International Christian Centre, the attack happened at midnight in Tarka Local Government Area, close to Makurdi, the state capital. Photographs of lifeless bodies of the victims were said to have been seen with several machete cuts. The body of a toddler was also seen in one of the photographs. Benue is predominantly a Christians state. Governor Samuel Ortom has always raised questions against the recurrent violence in the state. The governor continued to advocate for the protection of Christians in the state. This has made Ortom a prime target of the militants with an attempt on his life in 2021. Last year, Nigeria earned the record of being the worst country in terms of Christian persecution in the ICC’s 2021 Persecutor of the Year Awards as armed bandits reportedly killed thousands of Christians and leaving more than 3 million people displaced.over the years. “Christian communities in the Middle Belt region of Nigeria have effectively suffered a 20-year genocide,” said ICC President, Jeff King.
