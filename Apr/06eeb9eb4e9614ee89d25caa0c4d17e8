 BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO Some angry youths of Ile-Ife, Osun State, have protested the death of a suspect, Olufemi Oriyomi who was arrested with two others for alleged ritual killing by men of the state police. Police spokesperson, SP Yemisi Opalola had confirmed the death of Oriyomi, saying that the suspect fell sick and was taken to hospital for treatment before he died. Reacting to the news of the death of the suspect, some youths were said to have invaded Moore Police Station in Ile-Ife on Friday night and threw stones and pebbles at the building. It was gathered that a team from the station had arrested Oriyomi and two others for allegedly possessing human heart. The development caused pandemonium in the ancient city as residents ran helter skelter while gunshots rented the air. The Moore area was deserted during the gunshots. On Saturday morning, the youths resumed their violent demonstration after they gathered at Iloro and Oke-Isoda areas of the town. At Oke-Isoda, the protesters reportedly blocked road and accused the police of killing Oriyomi who they claimed was innocent of the allegation levelled. It was gathered that a bullet hit one of the protesters who died on the spot at Oke-Isoda. The confusion in the area was aggravated upon the protester’s killing. When contacted, a traditional ruler in the town, High Chief Adeyeye Adekola, Lowa Adimula of Ife Kingdom, said the youths had been prevailed upon to allow peace to reign in the town adding that the community awaited investigation by the police. Opalola confirmed the protest to our correspondent on the telephone but denied that the Moore police station was torched. The PPRO also could not confirm that a protester was shot dead adding that those who were protesting were suspected internet fraudsters popularly known as “Yahoo boys.”
