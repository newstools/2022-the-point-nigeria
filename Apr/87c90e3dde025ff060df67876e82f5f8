 BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO The National Secretary of the ruling All Progressives Congress, Senator Iyiola Omisore on Thursday boasted that his emergence in the new position would fetch Governor Gboyega Oyetola of Osun State a second term. Omisore, while speaking yesterday in Osogbo during a programme organised by the state chapter of the party to celebrate his emergence, urged all members to show appreciation to the APC for allowing him to serve in the secretary capacity. He said: “My emergence as the National Secretary of All Progressives Congress portends greatness, victory for Osun. “You know that Osun is APC state; so, we are overwhelmed by this privilege to serve as the national secretary of APC. “I admonish every member of APC and citizen of Osun State to appreciate the party for the privilege given to me by voting massively for Governor Oyetola in July 2022. “APC is united in Osun and we will do all our best to sustain this.”
