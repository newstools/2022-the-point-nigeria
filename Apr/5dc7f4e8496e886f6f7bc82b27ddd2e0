 Racing Genk striker Paul Onuachu reunited with his former FC Midtjylland coach Glen Riddersholm in November 2021, and the coach has tipped and advised the Nigerian star performer to get ready for the next big step in his career. With Riddersholm in the Midtjylland dugout, the Super Eagles star totaled twenty-seven appearances combined for the Wolves in three seasons and was on the scoresheet on three occasions. Having won the Golden Shoe, Belgian Professional Footballer of the Year and Ebony Shoe, Riddersholm is convinced that Onuachu has developed since he last worked with him and ready for the next big step in his career. Despite all the recent accolades, the Nigerian surprisingly did not make a move in the summer transfer window. And ahead of the opening of the next transfer window, big clubs such as Atletico Madrid and Liverpool have been mentioned as possible destinations for the 27-year-old. Riddersholm has insisted that Onuachu has what it takes to play for the Spanish and Premier League giants. “Yes, I’m absolutely convinced he is. I’m not saying he can play solid for those clubs, but he can play a significant role. “For some of the clubs, he wants to be a squad player, where he has to have a few minutes, because they play many matches in one season. “The question is also whether he wants to be a solid starter every round or whether he has to take new steps. I cannot answer that. “But he has some eye-catching core competencies, which means that it does not surprise me that there are such big clubs in play. “Being able to change matches is super important, and Paul has some obvious qualities that are nice for a coach to have at his disposal,” Riddersholm concluded. Onuachu, who has a contract with Racing Genk until June 30, 30 2024, has notched 21 goals in all competitions so far this season.
