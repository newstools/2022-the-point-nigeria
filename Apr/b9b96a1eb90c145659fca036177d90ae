 Some yet-to-be-identified-gunmen have reportedly set ablaze the police stations at Osumenyi, Amichi and Ezinifite in Nnewi South Local Government Area of Anambra State. The daredevil gunmen were said to have stormed the facilities in the communities in the early hours of Friday. The three attacked communities share common boundaries with Orsu and Orlu in Imo State as well as with Ukpor, Azia, Orsumoghu, Mbosi and Isekke said to be notorious for banditry. The attack happened less than 12 hours after some unknown gunmen reportedly set some buildings ablaze in Nnewi South Local Government Headquarters in Ukpor. Prof. Chukwuma Soludo, the state governor, during his visit to the scene to assess the level of destruction, had promised to equip the police and other security agencies in order to curtail hoodlums terrorizing the area. The Police Public Relations Officer in the Command, Ikenga Tochukwu, confirmed the incident, saying that the affected police station had earlier been destroyed during the #EndSARS protests. He said, “No policeman was killed in the attacks because the police stations affected were destroyed by hoodlums during the #EndSARS protests and they were being renovated by respective communities where they are located. Unfortunately, hoodlums went and burnt them again. “No policeman was killed or wounded because nobody was using any of the places since they were still under renovation. “After the #EndSARS attack, we re-strategized. We are appealing to members of the public to avail us useful information on the people behind the destruction.” Meanwhile, following the attacks by hoodlums in the local government, the youth wing of the Association of Town Unions, Anambra State, ASATU, has summoned an emergency meeting of all the youth leaders in the state to avert a reoccurrence.
