 Some gunmen suspected to be Fulani have reportedly killed two persons and set ablaze 20 houses in a night attack in a community in Plateau State. This follows a recent attack which claimed five lives, on Thursday, in Laake, Kwall district, Bassa Local Government Area of Plateau State. The council has been a target of attacks by gunmen who destroy farmlands and crops. The Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association in the state accused the natives of poisoning their cattle, which they claimed led to the death of 90 cows. The National President of Irigwe Development Association, Prince Robert Ashi, on Friday, disclosed that two people were gunned down by killer herdsmen with 20 houses burnt in a midnight raid by the gunmen suspected to be Fulani herdsmen. According to him, the gunmen invaded Laake village at about 9pm on Thursday burning houses and killing the people. He said, “The people of the village had retired to bed when the gunmen attacked the village at about 9:45 pm. They killed two people, burnt down 20 houses and injured five persons. “It is unfortunate that this kind of attack can take place when security men are trying to halt the orgy of killings in Irigwe land. “Those who carried out this attack are still lurking around. Many of them are on top of the hills around us but I don’t know why it is difficult for the security agencies to dislodge them.” He appealed to both the government and the security agencies to come to their aid in the community.
