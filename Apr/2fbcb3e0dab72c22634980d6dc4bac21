 The Indigenous People of Biafra has announced the cancellation of its sit-at-home order in the South-East to embrace peace negotiations organised by the Anambra State Government. The News Agency of Nigeria reports, on Saturday, that IPOB yielded to the appeal by the Anambra State Government and traditional rulers to pave the way for peace as all Igbo stakeholders and religious leaders declared their intention to find a lasting solution to insecurity and incessant sit-at-home directives in the zone. The decision was disclosed by the Chairman, Anambra Traditional Rulers Council, Igwe Nnaemeka Achebe, during a one-day peace building and security meeting held in Awka on Saturday. Achebe, the Igwe of Onitsha, said that the stakeholders continually held meetings on the way forward, adding that after its meeting with the group on Friday, it was agreed that a call to release the IPOB leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, would be a step to dousing the tension in the state. He said that after the meeting, the group placed a call to all its members to sheathe their swords and go the way of dialogue. “We call on all who had taken to the way of gun to put down their guns and take up the olive leaf from the government to better themselves,” Achebe said. He said that the state government set April 4 for prayers aimed at seeking God’s face to restore peace in Anambra and the South-East as a whole. “Igboland has lost so much in the economic and social development of the zone and we are tired of the situation and want peace. “It is agreed that on Sunday, April 3, all churches will announce the IPOB’s decision to their faith to come out on Monday, 11am to their various churches to offer prayers to God for the restoration of peace and economic development,” he said.
