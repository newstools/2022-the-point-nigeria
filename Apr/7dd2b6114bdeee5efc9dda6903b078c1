 BY AGNES NWORIE, ABAKALIKI Residents of Ezza/Effium in Ohaukwu and Ebonyi local local government council areas of Ebonyi State have been thrown into mourning following an attack by some suspected warlords in Effium, which reportedly claimed no fewer than 26 lives. About 17 houses were also said to have been torched in the incident that happened in the early hours of Sunday, April 10. The affected villages are Ohagelede, Umuezeoka, Ebiaji and Ebbeta in Ezza/Effium and Ebonyi local government council areas. During a visit to the affected villages, people were seen in groups mourning their beloved family members who were reportedly killed in the attacks. Other people were busy relocating their family members out of the villages for fear of another attack. An eyewitness, Chief Daniel Nwanga, from Umuezeoka village, said that the incident happened in the early hours of Sunday in Ohagelede, Umuezeoka and Ebbeta where assailants from Effium invaded parts of Ezza leaving killings and destruction in its trail. Nwanga stated that “In the past three weeks, government has ordered for ceasefire in the community. We agreed to obey because we can’t disobey an order from the government. “They went to Izzi speaking area to trace our people and also killed eight people there and burnt more than 17 houses. Moses Nwafor from Ebbeta, whose wife, step mother, grandson and younger brother were reportedly killed in the fracas, stated that he was unaware that the war was still ongoing as a ceasefire had been announced.
