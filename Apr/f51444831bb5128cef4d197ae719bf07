 BY MOYINOLUWA BAMIDELE-LUCAS Operatives of the Ogun State Police Command have arrested two suspected cultists in connection with a supremacy clash in Abeokuta. Habeeb Muideen (aka Oko 8) and Ibrahim (aka Ayin), were arrested by the SWAT team of the command in the early hours of Sunday. A statement by the Ogun State Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, said the suspects were members of the dreaded Aiye cult group and were involved in a deadly battle with a rival group at Elega/Iberekodo axis of the state capital. Oyeyemi said the SWAT team swung into action after receiving a distress call on the supremacy battle between the groups. “Upon receiving the distress call, the Commander SWAT, CSP Kalejaye Olanrewaju, quickly led his men to the scene. “On sighting the policemen, the cultists ran to different directions but were hotly chased and Habeeb Muideen was arrested at Iberekodo while Ibrahim was apprehended at Ajitadun area of the metropolis. “The two suspects are currently undergoing interrogation at SWAT office to determine their roles in the clash which left one Eiye member dead. Recovered from the arrested suspects are battle axes and assaulted charms,” Oyeyemi said. He disclosed that in the last one month, not less than 37 members of various cult groups have been arrested since the command started clamping down on them across the state. The Commissioner of Police, Lanre Bankole, has ordered a comprehensive manhunt for the fleeing members of the cult groups.
