 Some aggrieved members of the All Progressives Congress in Osun Central Senatorial District have reportedly attacked the leadership of the party in the district over the zoning of the party’s senatorial ticket to Iwo. A meeting of stakeholders in the district, comprising 10 local government council areas, was summoned by the leadership of the party in the area. The meeting, which was attended by the incumbent senators and other co-contenders for the ticket, held at the constituency office, Agbowo, Iwo, had barely started when crisis erupted over the decision to zone the ticket to Iwo. The APC Chairman in the district, Oluremi Omolaoye, said that the party’s executive in the district agreed to retain the Senatorial ticket in Iwo. Omolaoye said that “To ensure that all political interests are properly factored in, the apex body of the party in her meeting held on the 23rd of April, 2022 unanimously resolved that the Senate seat of this district for the 2023 election is herein zoned to Iwo Federal Constituency.” In reaction to the announcement, supporters of other aspirants shouting, “Ikire, Ikire,” “Ejigbo, Ejigbo,” charged angrily towards the high table. Sensing danger, the meeting was brought to an abrupt end in order to avoid violence. Some of the party chieftains at the gathering are Yunusa Amobi, Ayo Omidiran, Patricia Eteh, Professor Mojeed Alabi and Professor Ladipo among others.
