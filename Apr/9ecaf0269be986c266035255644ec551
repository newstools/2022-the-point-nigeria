 BY MAYOWA SAMUEL The Inspector-General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba, has  charged all personnel of the Force to take full advantage of the police health facilities in their respective commands and formations especially in light of the recent acquisition and distribution on the basis of need, of hospital equipment necessary for both basic and advanced health services to police hospitals, clinics, and cottage health centres around the country. As part of events to mark this year’s World Malaria Day, the IGP has ensured the distribution of the acquired medical facilities which included amongst others 50 Oxygen Cylinders, 50 Oxygen Regulators, 52 Chemical Sprayers, 4 Electrocardiogram (ECG) machines, Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs), Anesthetic Machines and accessories, Operating Tables, Hospital Beds/Mattresses, Incubators, Autoclaves, Suction Machines. The Force Public Relations Officer, Olumuyiwa Adejobi, said in a statement in Abuja on Sunday that the IGP noted that the services of Police Hospitals and Health Care Facilities are not restricted to Police personnel alone as well-meaning members of the public can equally access and benefit from the top-notch services rendered at the Police Medical facilities across the country. “The Inspector-General of Police equally admonishes police personnel to take advantage of these health facilities and engage in physical exercises, medical checks and good diet to improve their living conditions and reduce avoidable deaths while on duty, and subsequently advance their service delivery. “Similarly, the IGP, in the spirit of the 2022 World Health Day, charges the general public to regularly imbibe good health conditions, environmental sanitation, reduction of activities responsible for the depletion of the ozone layer and all sorts of pollutions that are capable of damaging our ecosystem which in turn kills us silently on a regular basis,” Adejobi said.
