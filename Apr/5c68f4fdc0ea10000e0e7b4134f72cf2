I joined them in the mid-season and from there I got a bigger offer in a First Division team in Liberia known as Earth Angels where I was signed on the 30th of September 2021. “I featured for Earth Angels in the Petro Trade Cup before Shaita Angels FC came calling for my services at the commencement of the mid-season. “Like I said, I started the second round of the season with Shaita Angels FC and in the 9 matches I featured for the club, I have scored 8 goals,” Offorma said. On her expectations in her chosen career Offorma added: “My expectation for Shaita Angels FC is to work hard and help them win the Liberian Female League and play at the CAF Female Champions League. “However, my ultimate goal is to wear the green-and-white jersey of the Super Falcons and win the FIFA Women’s World Cup for Nigeria.”
