The suit filed by Aloy Ejimakor, a senior counsel, on behalf of Nnamdi Kanu, was adjourned on Wednesday to May 12, at a court in Umuahia, Abia State. The indication was given in a Facebook message posted on Aloy Ejimakor’s page. The message read, “When the matter came up for hearing for the first time before the Federal High Court in Umuahia on March 25, 2022, the court had on its own motion directed the parties to address it (the court) on whether it had territorial jurisdiction or not based on the fundamental rights violations alleged against the Federal Government of Nigeria, which occurred in Kenya. “At the March hearing, the court had adjourned the matter for hearing of the parties on their written addresses on the territorial jurisdiction to April 27, 2022.” It read that the respondents in the suit, “namely, the Federal Republic of Nigeria, the President, and the Attorney General of the Federation did not file the address on point of law as was directed by the court on March 25, 2022.” “For this reason, Amos Enoch, leading other lawyers from the office of the Attorney General, who appeared for the three respondents, pleaded with the court to grant the respondents an extension of time to file their written addresses. “Upon consideration, the court granted their request and adjourned the matter for hearing on the written addresses of the parties to May 12, 2022.” It added that Ejimakor filed the originating suit “seeking the enforcement of the fundamental rights of Nnamdi Kanu against unlawful arrest, torture, unlawful detention, unlawful disappearance, his right to fair hearing and above all, his right against unlawful expulsion otherwise known as extraordinary rendition.” The reliefs sought by Ejimakor included, “order of court prohibiting the prosecution of Nnamdi Kanu on the strength of the unlawful rendition; his repatriation to his last place of abode abroad or to his country of nationality, Britain; and N25billion damages and an official apology.”
