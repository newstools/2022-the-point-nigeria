 There was a mild drama at the House of Representatives plenary on Wednesday as the deputy speaker, Idris Wase, turned down a motion seeking to probe police personnel’s invasion of a high court sitting in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State, recently. The motion, presented by Serguis Ogun, representing Esan North Federal Constituency of Edo State, was listed as number 10 on the agenda. There was an uproar as Wase skipped the 10th motion and moved to the 11th. When Ogun called the attention of the deputy speaker to the motion that was skipped, Wase said that he deliberately skipped it on the allegation that Ogun was making noise at plenary. However, Ogun refuted the allegation, saying that he was discussing his motion with his colleague. He said that “My motion is the next listed, I’m here to take it. Mr. Speaker, I know you have the power not to take it.” The Chief Whip of the House, Mohammed Monguno, picked holes in Ogun’s behaviour and called for his sanction to serve as deterrent to others. Ogun, however, tendered an apology to the House prompting Wase to grant him pardon. Wase later directed Ogun to move his motion but the House rejected it via a voice vote allegedly in reaction to Ogun’s earlier misdemeanor.
