 BY MAYOWA SAMUEL The Anambra State chapter of the All Progressives Congress has expressed sadness over the passing of the Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi III. This was contained in a statement issued by the state’s publicity secretary, Okelo Madukaife on Saturday. The late Alaafin died on Friday night at the Afe Babalola University Teaching Hospital, Ado Ekiti, Ekiti State. Extolling the virtues of the late mornach, the party described him as “a bridge between the older and younger generations, culturally and historically.” Noting that his exit came “at a time when his invaluable experience is required to contribute in navigating the nation to a greater future in 2023,” the party expressed hope that “the legacy of the royal deceased will guide the kingdom he is leaving behind.” Aged 83, he was the longest reigning Alaafin in history, after he had ruled for 52 years. The sad news of his passing came months after the death of the Olubadan of Ibadan, Saliu Adetunji, and the Soun of Ogbomoso, Jimoh Oyewumi.
