BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO Some young boys suspected to be cultists have hacked a middle aged man with cutlasses and axes in Osogbo, capital of Osun State. The hoodlums were said to have given the victim, who simply identified himself as Jare, a hot chase from Costain Area to Bolorunduro community of Oke-Baale, Osogbo, around 1:45pm on Tuesday before he was attacked. Eyewitnesses’ account in the area revealed that Jare was pursued by the hoodlums who were armed with cutlasses and axes and was screaming ‘help me’ while running within the street. The victim, who was wearing a blue colour knicker without any shirt on, was said to have been caught up along a bush path in the area and was macheted while the three gang hoodlums smashed a brick on him. “i suddenly saw the guy (Jare) running and screaming for help and few seconds after he passed my house, I saw three small boys with cutlasses and axes chasing him. “Few minutes after they passed, we discovered that the young man who was only putting on a knicker had been caught. We saw matchete cuts all over his body and broken bricks that were apparently smashed on him. “I suspect they are gang of cultists and might have wanted to attack the man. The man didn’t die because he told us his name as Jare and asked us to assist in calling his mother on phone. “After saying his mother’s phone number, one of the residents of the area phoned the mother and informed her of her son’s condition. Later, his family came to the area to take him to the hospital. “Some of the community members reported the matter at Oke-Baale Police Division but the police said they don’t have vehicle to take the victim to the hospital. When they could not get a commercial vehicle, they left the station,” one of the residents explained. Efforts to contact the Police Public Relations Officer, Yemisi Opalola, proved arbotive as she didn’t pick telephone calls.
