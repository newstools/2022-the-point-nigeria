BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO Two nonagenarians and other elderly people were among the first set of voters who arrived their polling units to cast their votes at the ongoing governorship election in Osun State. One of them, a 95-year-old Pa Benjamin Adekunle, who was holding a walking stick and a Permanent Voter’s Card said he arrived alongside his wife, Madam Adekunle. While Adekunle was offered a seat at Unit 7, ward 8, Oogi village in Ayedaade Local Government Area of the state, his wife was standing on the queue for accreditation and voting. Speaking at the polling unit as at 8:00am when our correspondent arrived, Pa Adekunle said he came out as early as 7am, before the arrival of INEC officials to vote for his preferred candidate. He expressed faith in a better Nigeria despite challenges confronting the nation. The aged voter disclosed that he has been voting since 1952, and urged younger Nigerians not to lose hope of a better future for the country. Adekunle, while setting agenda for whoever would be elected as the next governor in the state, urged the new governor to construct roads, provide electricity, water and improve the economy of the state. “I am 95 years of age and I had been voting since 1952. I still have faith in this country. I am here to exercise my civic responsibility and to vote for my candidate for better dividends of democracy,” he said. Asked the time he arrived, he said, “I have been here with my wife since 7am. This is because I want to vote on time and return home. As you can see, I can’t stand for long, that’s why I am sitting. I believe in a better Nigeria.” Adekunle, however, appealed to political candidates in the election not to see the election as a do-or-die affair. “Politics is a game and not a fight. No matter what the outcome of the election might be, the winner and the loser should see themselves as one,” he said. He commended INEC for timely arrival at the polling unit. Also speaking at the same polling unit, Mrs Shabina Oladipo, aged 90, said she arrived almost same time with Adekunle to exercise their franchise. Oladipo said she came out early to vote because of her desire for peace and development of the state. She said she believed that her preferred candidate would fulfil his campaign promises. Oladipo appealed to electorate, especially youths to come out and vote and expressed displeasure at some lackadaisical attitudes of youths towards performing their civic responsibility. “I have been here before INEC people arrived. I want the new governor to make things easy for us in this state. We need to have food, good hospitals, road and good health. I have always voted in elections and I won’t stop.” Also, another aged who said she couldn’t remember her age, Mrs Mariani Adegbite, said she wanted to vote for a good leader to emerge. Madam Adegbite voted at Ward 6, Unit 7,St David Primary School, Ode-Omu, Ayedaade Local Government Area of the state. <img src="https://www.thepointng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220716-WA0019-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-97686" srcset="https://www.thepointng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220716-WA0019-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.thepointng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220716-WA0019-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.thepointng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220716-WA0019-113x150.jpg 113w, https://www.thepointng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220716-WA0019-150x200.jpg 150w, https://www.thepointng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220716-WA0019-300x400.jpg 300w, https://www.thepointng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220716-WA0019-696x928.jpg 696w, https://www.thepointng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220716-WA0019-315x420.jpg 315w, https://www.thepointng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220716-WA0019.jpg 864w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /> <img src="https://www.thepointng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220716-WA0017-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-97687" srcset="https://www.thepointng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220716-WA0017-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.thepointng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220716-WA0017-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.thepointng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220716-WA0017-150x113.jpg 150w, https://www.thepointng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220716-WA0017-696x522.jpg 696w, https://www.thepointng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220716-WA0017-560x420.jpg 560w, https://www.thepointng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220716-WA0017-80x60.jpg 80w, https://www.thepointng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220716-WA0017-265x198.jpg 265w, https://www.thepointng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220716-WA0017.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />
