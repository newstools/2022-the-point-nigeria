EFL Championship outfit Luton Town are the frontrunners to sign 2019 Golden Eaglets invitee Aribim Pepple. Already, Luton Town has agreed a deal to sign the talented 19-year-old after his proposed move to Forest Green Rovers was hijacked. Pepple’s next destination has been hot topic after a blistering start to the season with six goals in nine appearances for Cavalry FC in the Canadian Premier League. When he found the net against Pacific FC on July 1, he became the first player in Canadian Premier League history to score in five consecutive games in the division. On the back of his imperious form, Pepple was courted by a plethora of clubs, however, Luton Town are set to announce his capture in the coming days, with the player already agreeing a three-year deal. Born in Kettering, England, he is also eligible to represent Canada at international level, having moved to the North American country when he was five years old. Pepple trained with English clubs Leicester City and Sheffield United with a view to a permanent move in 2020, and previously played for Calgary Foothills FC USL2 team before joining Cavalry FC.
