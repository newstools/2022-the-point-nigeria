 BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO The Ataoja of Osogbo, Oba Jimoh Olanipekun has rained curses on thugs who were hired by politicians to launch attacks on opposition parties ahead of the July 16 governorship election. Olanipekun, who could not hide his displeasure over pockets of politically-motivated attacks across the state and especially in Osogbo, the state capital, cursed those fomenting trouble in the state and earned them to desist or face the wrath of the gods. The feasibly-angry traditional ruler, made these remarks when the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Senator Ademola Adeleke visited his palace to seek royal blessings ahead of the poll. Adeleke had informed the monarch of some attacks that his campaign train had suffered in the past. The governorship hopeful also claimed that some thugs attacked his supporters on their way to the palace on Tuesday. Reacting, Oba Olanipekun warned that he would not tolerate any political party to distrupt the peace of his domain before, during and after the election. Specifically, the monarch accused the Chairman, Olorunda Unit of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW), Mr Kazeem Oyewale, popularly known as ‘Asiri Eniba’ of causing havoc in Osogbo and laid curses on the transporter and others. Olanipekun said, ‘I want to say it emphatically that anyone who disturbs the peace of Osogbo land won’t know peace. Anyone who wants to destroy this land won’t know peace. Go and tell them and let Asiri Eniba know that I won’t tolerate distruption of peace in my domain. Oyetola came here, he was not attacked, APC people visited my palace, PDP didn’t attack them. I want you people to know that PDP enthroned me.”
