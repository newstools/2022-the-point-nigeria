BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO Billionaire businessman and the scion of Adeleke dynasty, Deji Adeleke has pledged to be a strong promoter and defender of good governance under the administration of his brother, Ademola Adeleke, the governor-elect of Osun State. Speaking during the convocation ceremony of the Adeleke University in Ede on Sunday, the business mogul assured Osun people that he will be a guarantor of responsible governance listening and serving the best interest of the state. According to him, he would not only support his brother to deliver on his electoral promises , he will also be a whistle-blower against bad governance and serve as a guarantor for a government delivering dividends of democracy to the good people of Osun state. While reaffirming that there will be no godfatherism under his brother, the global business icon asserted that he would be the first to call out the government in cases of governance errors even as he noted that there will be no place for corrupt appointees in the new administration. The founder of Adeleke University declared that the incoming governor will not allow those interested in self-enrichment to make his cabinet and government, adding that he will ensure that the administration is regulated by probity, accountability and transparency. In a solemn pledge to Osun people, Adeleke dispelled rumours that the incoming governor will refund billions of naira expended on his elections, describing such reports as unfounded as he is committed to further investment in Osun state as he has done in other parts of the federation. According to him, no refund is expected from the Governor-elect as the Adeleke family undertook the project with the sole goal of liberating Osun people from bad governance and irresponsive leadership. “Let me reassure Osun people that Senator Adeleke Ademola Nurudeen is not and will not be under the influence of any godfather. He is a man of himself who will work assiduously for the great people of Osun state who graciously elected him,” the global business investor affirmed.
