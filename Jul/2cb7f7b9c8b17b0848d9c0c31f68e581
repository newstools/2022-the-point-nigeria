Despite rising inflation in Africa’s most populous nation, investment in the stock market, contrary to expectations, has continued to yield good returns for investors as year-to-date returns stood above 21 percent at the end of June. The implication is that investment in the market hedges inflation and offers positive return as at the review period. BAMIDELE FAMOOFO reports.  As at the end of May 2022, inflation in Nigeria’s largest economy stood at 17.71 percent, rising consistently for four months. Elsewhere, the situation is the same as rising inflation continues to threaten the global economy with Central Banks increasing interest rates to curb the menace. In Nigeria, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Central Bank increased the Monetary Policy Rate by 150 basis points to 13 percent in a deft move to curb inflation. However, investment in the nation’s capital market has maintained a positive stance as yield remains positive year-to-date as at June 30, 2022. Figures published by the Nigerian Exchange Limited put year-to-date return as at June 30, 2022 at 21.31 percent which is above the inflation figure which printed 17.71 percent as at end of May. Stock Analysts at Coronation Research led by Ola Ani disclosed that the NGX All-Share Index posted its best half-year performance in five years with market capitalization closing at N27.94 trillion. Ending the first half of the year, Nigerian equities rebounded slightly as the benchmark index managed to eke out a meager 3bps gain to close at 51,817.59 points, the highest point since 27 June. The gain contributed to keep the index well on track for its second week of gain in the month and biggest half-year gain since half-year 2017. The market’s performance was driven primarily by investor interest in UBN (+4.24%), FBNH (+1.75%) and SEPLAT (+0.78%). Consequently, the year-to-date return increased to 21.31 percent, while market capitalization gained N8.15 billion to close at N27.94 trillion. Analysis of market activities on the last trading day in June showed trade turnover settled higher relative to the previous session, with the value of transactions advancing by 12.01 percent. A total of 223.11million units of shares valued at N3.87 billion were exchanged in 4,213 deals. FBNH (+1.75%), led the volume chart with 36.63 million units traded, while MTNN (0.00%) led the value chart in deals worth N1.37 billion. Market breadth closed positive at a 1.06-to-1 ratio with advancing issues outnumbering declining ones. UPL (+9.79%) led eighteen (18) others on the gainer’s table, while PZ (-9.86%) topped 17 others on the laggard’s log. Domestic investors to the rescue Activities of local investors drove the performance of the stock market in the first- half of 2022 as foreign investors are on the run due to currency fluctuations. Foreign investors only account for around 13 percent of trading on the exchange compared with a long-term average of around 42 percent. The foreign funds remaining are either unable to withdraw or remain committed to the Nigerian investment case for the long term. Since the beginning of 2018, around N439.43 billion ($1.04bn at today’s rate) of foreign investor money has left the NGX Exchange. On 23 June MSCI Inc., a global provider of equity, fixed income and real estate indexes, announced that it is considering removing Nigeria from its Frontier Markets Indexes (MSCI Frontier Markets and MSCI Frontier Markets 100 indexes), citing currency restrictions. Specifically, since March 2020, FX illiquidity and the widening chasm between the official and parallel Naira exchange rates, according to MSCI Inc., have led to FX conversion and fund repatriation problems for foreign investors in the Nigerian equities market. As a result, according to MSCI Inc, “Market participants have continuously expressed concerns related to the investability and replicability of the MSCI Nigeria Indexes and related composite indexes, such as the MSCI Frontier Markets Index.” This is not the first time MSCI Inc has considered removing Nigeria from the MSCI Frontier Markets (FM) Index. In April 2016, a similar situation occurred owing to the Central Bank of Nigeria’s currency restrictions at the time. The market’s view then was that around $500 million in funds benchmarked to the MSCI FM index would head for the exit. In the end, Nigeria was not ejected, FX liquidity improved a year later (2017), and foreign investors bought Nigerian equities again in significant volumes. The situation now, six years later, is very different in terms of potential impact. Financial experts at Financial Derivatives Company Limited headed by Bismarck Rewane predicted that foreign participation in the stock market will maintain its lackluster posture in the meantime. “We expect portfolio inflows to remain significantly below pre-pandemic levels, given the lower yields on fixed income instruments and OMO bills compared to historical trends and CBN’s capital control measures. On FDI, we do not expect any significant divergence from historical trends due to the (1) continued presence of structural rigidities, (2) socio-economic problems, (3) policy inconsistencies, and (4) election uncertainties.” June in retrospect

While year to date return was green at the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange in the review period +81.01 percent, All-Share Index dropped by -201.89 or -1.02 percent. Outlook Rewane noted that investor sentiment has been jittery due to expectations of another interest rate hike in July as inflationary pressures remain in the country. “The interest rate hike will make investors rotate their funds to fixed income securities due to higher yields and dampen market sentiment. Market is expected to trade horizontally until the release of H1’22 corporate results,” he said.
