A cheque of N5million approved by Borno State Governor, Babagana Zulum has been presented to a private school to fund a scholarship for Musa Sani, a 13-year-old talented Borno kid who used mud to replicate the state’s first flyover around the customs round-about in Maiduguri. The payment was made to Golden Olive Academy, Maiduguri, to cater for Musa’s education from primary four to completion of Senior Secondary School. Musa was born into a less privileged family living around Gwange area in Maiduguri. He was a primary three pupil at a Community school
in Gwange. Musa recently caught Zulum’s attention when he used mud to design a flyover that was commissioned by President Muhammadu Buhari in Maiduguri, back in December. Governor Zulum was amazed by the kid’s brilliance. He met his family and offered to approve scholarship for him, to harness his talents. The Governor directed the Borno State Education Trust Fund to fund the boy’s education. Chairperson of ETF, Hauwa Biu, presented a cheque of Five Million and Twenty Nine Thousand Naira (N5,029,000), with the fund already paid to a private school at which Musa is now schooling. Biu thanked Governor Zulum for the offer and urged the boy to focus on his studies and make the Governor proud. <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-97846" src="https://www.thepointng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/WhatsApp-Image-2022-07-18-at-12.20.19-PM-300x225.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://www.thepointng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/WhatsApp-Image-2022-07-18-at-12.20.19-PM-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://www.thepointng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/WhatsApp-Image-2022-07-18-at-12.20.19-PM-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https://www.thepointng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/WhatsApp-Image-2022-07-18-at-12.20.19-PM-150x113.jpeg 150w, https://www.thepointng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/WhatsApp-Image-2022-07-18-at-12.20.19-PM-696x522.jpeg 696w, https://www.thepointng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/WhatsApp-Image-2022-07-18-at-12.20.19-PM-1068x801.jpeg 1068w, https://www.thepointng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/WhatsApp-Image-2022-07-18-at-12.20.19-PM-560x420.jpeg 560w, https://www.thepointng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/WhatsApp-Image-2022-07-18-at-12.20.19-PM-80x60.jpeg 80w, https://www.thepointng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/WhatsApp-Image-2022-07-18-at-12.20.19-PM-265x198.jpeg 265w, https://www.thepointng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/WhatsApp-Image-2022-07-18-at-12.20.19-PM.jpeg 1156w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-97845" src="https://www.thepointng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/WhatsApp-Image-2022-07-18-at-12.19.37-PM-300x225.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://www.thepointng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/WhatsApp-Image-2022-07-18-at-12.19.37-PM-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://www.thepointng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/WhatsApp-Image-2022-07-18-at-12.19.37-PM-150x113.jpeg 150w, https://www.thepointng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/WhatsApp-Image-2022-07-18-at-12.19.37-PM-696x522.jpeg 696w, https://www.thepointng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/WhatsApp-Image-2022-07-18-at-12.19.37-PM-560x420.jpeg 560w, https://www.thepointng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/WhatsApp-Image-2022-07-18-at-12.19.37-PM-80x60.jpeg 80w, https://www.thepointng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/WhatsApp-Image-2022-07-18-at-12.19.37-PM-265x198.jpeg 265w, https://www.thepointng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/WhatsApp-Image-2022-07-18-at-12.19.37-PM.jpeg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />
