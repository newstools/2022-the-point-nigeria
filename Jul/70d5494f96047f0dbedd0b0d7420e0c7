EFL League Two club Crawley Town has confirmed the capture of former Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur centre-back Tobi Omole. Omole has joined the Red Devils as a free agent after rejecting a new deal at Tottenham Hotspur. The 22-year-old has put pen to paper on a two-year contract that will keep him at the Broadfield Stadium until June 30, 2024. Omole is credited with fifty-one appearances for the two north London clubs in the Premier League 2, scoring three goals. While at Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur, he faced Football League opposition Coventry City, Portsmouth, Northampton Town, Cambridge United and Stevenage in the Papa John’s Trophy. In his first words as a Crawley Town player, Omole stated: “I am here to achieve promotion, I am a ball-playing centre-back and am excited to be a part of this new project at Crawley Town.” The exciting Nigerian defender wasn’t involved for Crawley Town in weekend’s friendly against Queens Park Rangers and will start training with his new teammates this week.
Omole will be tutored by former Arsenal U23 manager Kevin Betsy in the 2022-2023 campaign.
