The Police Command in Lagos has arrested four suspected members of rival cult groups over their alleged nefarious and criminal activities in the Badagry area of the state. Spokesperson for the command, Superintendent of Police, Benjamin Hundeyin, confirmed the arrest in a statement issued on Saturday in Lagos. Hundeyin said that the arrest of the suspects followed series of complaints from some residents of area about their frequent violent activities and killings. “The arrest of the suspects followed painstaking week-long investigation into the incessant complaints of cult-related disturbances and killings in Badagry. “They were arrested in various parts of Badagry in an operation that lasted days. “Preliminary investigation reveals that the suspects belong to Eiye and Aiye confraternities. “The suspects will be arraigned at the conclusion of a more comprehensive investigation,” he said. Hundeyin quoted the Commissioner of Police in the state, Abiodun Alabi, as assuring the people of the state that the command would continue to combat cultism and related crimes toward ensuring lasting peace in the state.
