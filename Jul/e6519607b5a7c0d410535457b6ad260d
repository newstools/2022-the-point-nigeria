 BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO The Federal Road Maintenance Agency has completed the first phase of the dilapidated bridge along Omoolupe-Cocoa axis in Ilesa, Osun State, following a series of complaints and pleas by road users and other residents of the town. FERMA responded to the outcry by the road users for the repair of the dilapidated bridge as it moved its personnel and equipment to the site in May, this year. Exactly a month after, the agency completed the first phase of the project. On the time frame for the project, the engineer in charge of FERMA in Osun State, Bamidele Fasoranti, said that his men started work on the bridge on June 1 as promised without compromising standard. Fasoranti, therefore, enjoined motorists and other road users to cooperate with his men working assiduously to ensure timely completion of the project. Investigation showed that three of the four phases of the construction work had been completed while the fourth is in progress.
