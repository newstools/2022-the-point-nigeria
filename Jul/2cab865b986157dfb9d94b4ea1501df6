BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO The Accord Party’s candidate in the forthcoming Osun State governorship election holding on Saturday, Akin Ogunbiyi has expressed a rude shock over the attack on Lasun Yussuff, the Labour Party candidate by some unknown assailants. This was contained in a press statement issued in Osogbo on Monday by the media team of Ogunbiyi’s Campaign Organisation. Ogunbiyi stated that the attack on the LP candidate’s residence was wicked and unfortunate and a sign that politicians had not learnt any good lesson from past occurrences. The Accord candidate thanked God that Yussuff and his family members were not hurt in the attack. Ogunbiyi, however, urged all and sundry to shun evil and any action that could disturb the peace of the state. He affirmed that the blood of anyone in the state must not be shed to secure the victory of anyone at the polls. He prayed that God will continue to shield Yussuff, his family and supporters from any form of evil, adding that the people of the state should exercise their franchise freely by voting accordingly.
