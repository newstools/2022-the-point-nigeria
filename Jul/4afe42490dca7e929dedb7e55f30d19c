BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO The governorship candidate of Action Peoples Party (APP), Adeolu Adebayo, has accused the Peoples Democratic Party of hijacking his polling agents. He, however, urged security agents across the state to disallow all the party agents at the polling units. Adebayo alleged that his party agent across the state have been compromised and hijacked by the PDP. The guber candidate said on Saturday, “It has been discovered that all my party agents across Osun state were strangers, I don’t know them and they are never members of Action Peoples Party (APP). “This was noticed on the passport photograph of my party state agent was not anyone from my party. I start doing my findings to have a proof and discovered yesterday through some of the party members seeing my party agents tags with strange people. “Further investigation revealed that members of the PDP are the one behind this evil act. I therefore request a fast action and approach by the Commissioner of Police; never to allow anyone carry APP party agent tags at the polling units across Osun state. Arrest should be made in any case of someone seen carry APP party agents tags,” he said.
