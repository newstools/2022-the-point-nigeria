BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO The Osun State governor-elect, Ademola Adeleke, has said it was not true the insinuation that the Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola worked for his victory in the just concluded governorship election. Adeleke, the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party was declared winner of the poll on Sunday by the Independent National Electoral Commission after defeating the incumbent governor, Gboyega Oyetola of the ruling All Progressives Congress. There was an insinuation that Aregbesola, who has been engrossed in serious feud with Oyetola and the APC presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, had instructed his supporters, especially members of the APC caucus loyal to him to vote for Adeleke. However, while speaking on live television programme on Monday night, Adeleke said he never spoke with Aregbesola prior to the poll and neither was he aware of his rumoured support. He, however, admitted that some of the minister’s allies joined forces with him to defeat Oyetola. He said it was not an easy task defeating the incumbent Governor saying that, “it is not easy to defeat an incumbent anywhere in the world.” “I did not work with Aregbesola, I did not even speak to him, but I know some APC members and his allies that joined us. I can’t tell whether Aregbesola asked his associates to support me or not because I never had a conversation with him,” the governor-elect said.
