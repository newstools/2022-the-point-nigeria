 BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO The candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in the Osun State governorship election slated for next week Saturday, Senator Ademola Adeleke has promised to transform the state capital, Osogbo to London if elected. He accused the ruling All Progressives Congress of bastardising the state, impoverishing the people and denying workers and pensioners their entitlements. Adeleke stated this when he visited the Ataoja of Osogbo, Oba Jimoh Olanipekun at his palace during his campaign in the capital city. He said, “They (APC government) have destroyed Osun. But I have come to rescue Osun. All of you know that I won in 2018 and you know how things went. I am from a rich family and I will use my wealth to transform this state. What is paining them is that I said Osun’s money should stay in Osun. “Don’t allow them to deceive us again. Their deceit is coming to an end soon. Enough is enough. Osogbo remains the capital and we will continue to transform Osogbo. They have tried all they could to pitch Osogbo and Ede towns against each other. APC is rich in propaganda and they like twisting facts. Next week Saturday, after voting PDP, just say bye bye to hunger. “If you know the amount thy sold LAUTECH, you will be shocked. They sold it for N8 billion despite claiming to be richer than Osun State. When I become governor, I will turn Osogbo to London. Workers will enjoy during my time. The APC government has been subjecting Osun monarchs to suffering. I will build a secretariat for Obas in Osogbo. Out government we value Obas and pay their entitlements,” Adeleke promised.
