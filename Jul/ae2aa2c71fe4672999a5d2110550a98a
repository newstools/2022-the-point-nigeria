The CEO, Wyoming Capital & Partners, Tajudeen Olayinka, noted that improved liquidity in the system in the last six months is responsible for the positive performance of the Nigerian stock market. Other factors driving liquidity in the equities market he added are: “instant payment of dividends to shareholders through electronic means (e-dividend), provides opportunities for immediate reinvestment of these dividends, especially by institutional investors, who manage funds and portfolios for clients. This did not leave out other traditional investors, who took advantage of low prices, in the run-up to financial year-end rallies that we saw at the beginning of year 2022. “It is also because of the negative real return in the fixed income market and the need to hedge against inflation. Equity market is an inflation adjusting market, and so, some investors who were willing to hedge against inflation, irrespective of the downside risk that the market poses, decided to bring liquidity back to the equity market. “The ongoing crash in the crypto market brought liquidity back to the equity market. It has been said that more Nigerian investors participate actively in the crypto space, and so, the sudden, though long expected crash in that market, made some affected Nigerian investors cut their losses, for less volatile and recoverable opportunities in the equity market. “Availability of derivative products is encouraging more institutional investors to embrace the equity market. Investors can now short or long the market at ease. All these activities provide liquidity to the market.” Weekly performance review Closing the week, the Lagos bourse extended gains from the previous session, bringing the All-Share Index up by 2bp to close at 51,829.67 points.
