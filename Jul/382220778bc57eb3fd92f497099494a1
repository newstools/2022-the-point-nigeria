The Federal High Court sitting in Abuja, on Thursday disqualified Delta State Peoples Democratic Party governorship candidate, Sheriff Oborevwori, over discrepancies of the names on his certificates. Justice Taiwo Taiwo, who gave the judgment, ruled that Oborevwori was not qualified to contest in the first place. With the ruling, it means that his participation in the PDP governorship primaries was an aberration
The judgment, which granted all the prayers sought by the immediate past Chief of Staff in the state, David Edevbie, renders all votes cast for Oborevwori null and void and of no effect. A chieftain of the party, who spoke to The Point on condition of anonymity, said the party has been pushed to a tight corner because of time. He argued that this is not a development that should come at a time like this because of the time factor. With this judgment, it is left for the PDP to quickly arrange a substitution or wait for a possible appeal of the judgment by the Delta State House of Assembly Speaker, Sheriff Oborevwori. But we have to be mindful of time otherwise, this new Electoral Act has given the Independent National Electoral Commission a lot of powers. If we miss the timeline for substitution of candidates, it will mean that we have voluntarily allowed the opposition All Progressives Congress a free and easy ride to Government House Asaba. We should have known this would happen. The handwriting was all over the place but we did not heed good counsel or let me say we were too far carried away by mundane considerations. He has the right of appeal, he should do it quickly, he said. While advising the PDP to immediately submit Edevbies name as the partys candidate for the governorship poll, he observed that time is running out.
