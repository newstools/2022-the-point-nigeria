Leicester City coach Brendan Rodgers has expressed hope on the fast possible recovery on the injury suffered by Wilfred Ndidi ahead of his side’s 3-3 draw with sister club OH Leuven in a pre-season fixture at King Power at Den Dreef Stadion at the weekend. The Northern Irish football tactician fielded twenty-six players in the friendly which was split up into three periods but his Nigerian holding midfielder wasn’t named in the matchday squad having picked up an ankle complaint in training. Ndidi missed the last two months of the 2021-2022 campaign due to a knee injury which required surgery and was nearing a return to full fitness having resumed pre-season training with the squad before the latest setback. Rodgers revealed that Ndidi’s latest injury is not a major one and expects the Super Eagles star to return to training this week. Providing an injury update before the clash against OH Leuven, Rodgers said:  “We’ve got one or two knocks. Wilf’s twisted his ankle in training a few days ago. We don’t think it’s too serious. “It’s a high ankle sprain, so he had a scan on it and it’ll hopefully be okay. We’ve just looked after him really, he won’t be involved at the weekend, but of course, hopefully next week at some point he’ll be back training.” Despite his injury troubles last season, Ndidi made 31 all-competition appearances for the Foxes, scoring two goals in European competitions. His international teammate Kelechi Iheanacho came off the bench on the hour mark against OH Leuven – his second pre-season appearance. In their third pre-season friendly, Leicester City travel to the MKM Stadium to take on Hull City on Wednesday evening.
