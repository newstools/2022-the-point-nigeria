The Inspector-General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba, has commended the security operatives, particularly officers of the Nigeria Police Force, the Military, and other security agencies as well as the electorates in Osun State for the peaceful conduct of the elections held on Saturday July 16, 2022 in the three Senatorial Districts, 30 Local Government Areas and 3753 polling units of the state. Force Public Relations Officer, Olumuyiwa Adejobi, said in a statement on Sunday, that the IGP applauded the massive deployment of Police Operatives, Specialized Units, and other human and operational assets including three helicopters and a couple of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles for aerial surveillance in the three Senatorial Districts, four adequately manned gun boats for the riverine areas, and Armored Personnel Carriers which enabled swift responses to the pockets of electoral issues. He equally lauded the collaborative efforts of other security agencies which assisted in the peaceful conduct of the elections. Adejobi, a Chief Superintendent of Police, added that the IGP appreciated the electorates in Osun State as well as critical stakeholders for their role in collectively maintaining decorum and cooperating with law enforcement agencies, noting that the professionalism displayed by officers deployed for the election equally helped to garner trust, and ultimately led to the success of the process.
