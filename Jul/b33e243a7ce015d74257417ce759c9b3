Crystal Palace boss Patrick Vieira has included five Nigeria-eligible players in a 27-man squad for the club’s preseason tour to Singapore and Australia. Left-back Tayo Adaramola, defensive midfielder David Ozoh, winger Malcolm Ebiowei, strikers Victor Akinwale and Ademola Ola-Adebomi are part of the group, barring an unlikely last-minute change. Two Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) targets Eberechi Eze and Michael Olise have been left out of the traveling party to Asia. Palace youth team goal poachers Akinwale and Ola-Adebomi will fancy their chances of getting playing time during the tour, considering that experienced Christian Benteke is not part of the group. Belgium international striker Benteke has not been selected due to his Covid-19 vaccination status. The Eagles will take on Liverpool at the National Stadium in Singapore on July 15, before games against Manchester United (July 19, Melbourne) and Leeds United (July 22, Perth) in Australia. Vieira handed pre-season minutes to Eze, Adaramola and Ebiowei as Palace defeated south London rivals Millwall in an entertaining friendly at the
weekend.
