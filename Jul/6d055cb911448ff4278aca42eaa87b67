The Delta State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party has called on supporters and loyalists across the state to remain calm following the sacking of its governorship candidate by an Abuja Federal High Court on Thursday. Justice Taiwo Taiwo, ruling on a suit brought by Olorogun David Edevbie against the emergence of Sheriff Oborevwori,granted all the prayers of the petitioner and pronounced Oborevwori disqualified. In a statement by the State Publicity Secretary, Ifeanyi M. Osuoza,
the PDP said it “has received the judgement of an Abuja Federal High Court, against our Gubernatorial Candidate for the 2023 general elections, Rt. Hon. Sheriff Oborevwori, on the grounds of discrepancies in his documents. “We have already engaged our team of legal experts to critically study the ruling and explore grounds on which we can confidently approach the Court of Appeal. “We want to therefore enjoin our teeming supporters and loyal party faithful to remain calm, unperturbed, and law-abiding, and assure them that we are quite confident in our conviction, that justice will be done and we will get judgement at the Appellate Court. “There is no cause for alarm.” The statement which was posted on social media, however, angered many party faithful, who described it as divisive and provocative, saying the party shouldn’t have responded knowing that that the petitioner came second and until recently the Chief of Staff to the governor.
