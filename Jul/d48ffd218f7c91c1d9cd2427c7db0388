… Case adjourned till July 20 BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO The trial of the owner of Hilton Hotel, Ile-Ife, Osun State, Rahmon Adedoyin, and six of his hotel workers involved in the alleged murder of Timothy Adegoke, a Master’s student of Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU) has been stalled. The matter, which is being heard at Osun State High Court 1, was delayed owing to the absence of the presiding Chief Judge of the state, Justice Adepele Ojo. The court had adjourned till July 14 (Thursday) for ruling on an application made by the prosecuting counsel, Femi Falana, SAN, for the amendment of the charges against the seven defendants. As at the last hearing on June 27, the parties had argued the amendment application brought before the court by Femi Falana Chamber. Justice Ojo had adjourned to July 14 for ruling on the arguments canvassed on whether to allow the prosecution to amend the charges or refuse the amendment as prayed by the defence counsels. The presiding judge had also hinted that final written addresses of parties would be adopted on July 14. It was gathered that Ojo had embarked on a trip abroad and had not returned as at the time our correspondent visited the High Court on Thursday. However, the matter has further been adjourned till July 20 when the judge is expected to have returned to the country.
