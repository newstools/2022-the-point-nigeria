BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO The Lead Bishop of Worldwide Anglican Church in Nigeria, Bishop Seun Adeoye has described as fake, bishops and pastors who were present at the unveiling of Senator Kashim Shettima as Asiwaju Ahmed Tinubu’s running mate in the forthcoming presidential election. Adeoye said it was disgraceful and pathetic for the “so called Bishops and Pastors” to have disregard the warning of the Christian Association of Nigeria against political parties presenting Muslim-Muslim ticket for the 2023 presidential election. The Spokesman of World Bishops’ Council in Africa further decried the appearance of the ministers garbed in the holy garments who were seen scrambling for recognition in the midst of crowd at the event which took place at Yar’Adua Event Centre, Abuja. The clergyman in a statement made available to The Point in Osogbo on Wednesday, wondered what type of Christianity those bishops and pastors who attended the programme practiced. He said, “We need to know who the men of God who attended this event are, their churches and where they are coming from and if indeed they are genuine ministers of the gospel. “We need to know too, maybe, those garments were rented to be put on by those we saw in the pictures as an indication that Christians are in support of Muslim-Muslim ticket. “And if indeed they were real men of God as they claimed, then it is disgusting, disgraceful and pathetic for them to have disobeyed CAN. We know quite well that some are in the Church ministries because of the gods of their bellies. “Nobody should take those men serious. We need to be reminded of Judas Iscariot who betrayed Jesus Christ for a mere 30 pieces of silver. So, for them to have shunned the Christian body is an indication of who they are. “Nigerians should not take them serious. And we must just conclude that they are at the event at a cost. To me, they are fake men of God. We should understand that a Muslim-Muslim ticket is dangerous for a country like Nigeria.”
