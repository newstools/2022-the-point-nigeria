Look forward to a bright future, Adeleke tells Osun people BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO THE Peoples Democratic Party’s Governorship Candidate in the July 16 election in Osun State, Senator Ademola Adeleke, on Wednesday, received his Certificate of Return from the Independent National Electoral Commission as the state’s Governor-elect. The Certificate of Return was presented to Adeleke and the Deputy Governor-elect, Kola Adewusi, by the National Commissioner supervising Osun, Ogun and Oyo states, Prof. Kunle Ajayi, on behalf of the National Chairman of INEC, Prof Muhammud Yakubu, at the Commission’s headquarters in Osogbo. In his welcome address, the Resident Electoral Commissioner, Abdulganiy Raji, at the official presentation of the Certificate of Return, said the election was credible and urged Adeleke and other political office holders to fulfill their campaign promises in order to make life easy for citizens and also deepen internal democracy in political parties. Raji said, “As we are all aware, the Osun State Governorship Election has been conducted with utmost credibility and we appreciate Almighty God for the enablement.  I must appreciate the efforts of the members of staff of INEC in general under the supervision of Prof. Kunle Ajayi, the SNC, for displaying absolute professionalism and commitment to ensure the election outcome was generally acceptable. A big thank you to the electorate for believing in the Commission, most especially for trooping out en masse to exercise their franchise during the last election. “I would be an ingrate if I failed to recognise and appreciate the unalloyed support of the Security Agencies/Interagency Consultative Committee on Election Security (ICCES) members for ensuring adequate security before, during and after elections. “Osun State gubernatorial election has come and gone, but I need to reiterate these points that our democracy will be stronger if we come together to do the right things such as campaigning with fulfilable promises, modeling positive attitude and behaviour while in office, fulfilling campaign promises, doing away with money politics. Electorates are not asking for too much, just basic amenities to make every day life easy. “Abiding by these steps will not only make life easy for INEC but also ensure hitch-free electoral processes. While I congratulate the Governor Elect and Deputy Governor Elect, I thank you all for being here to witness this occasion,” he said. Meanwhile, Senator Adeleke has assured the people of the state that his administration would not let them down, adding that they should anticipate a bright future. The governor-elect dedicated his victory to his late brother, Isiaka Adeleke, and to the people of the state. He said, “I give thanks to God Almighty for this victory. This victory encourages the good people of Osun State. This victory would not have been possible but for the goodwill of the patriotic men, young and old, who worked hard to make sure we reclaimed our stolen mandate. “I am overwhelmed by your love and support and I do not take this trust you have bestowed on me for granted. Our state has now turned a new page and we can now look forward to a bright future and a path for progress and prosperity for our people under a free and fair election. Furthermore, I will like to specially recognise and appreciate my PDP family for their support. “I dedicate my victory to my late brother, the first executive governor of the state, Isiaka adeleke and every indigene of the state and to all my supporters, friends and families.” <img src="https://www.thepointng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220720-WA0030-277x300.jpg" alt="" width="277" height="300" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-98046" srcset="https://www.thepointng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220720-WA0030-277x300.jpg 277w, https://www.thepointng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220720-WA0030-138x150.jpg 138w, https://www.thepointng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220720-WA0030-150x163.jpg 150w, https://www.thepointng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220720-WA0030-300x325.jpg 300w, https://www.thepointng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220720-WA0030-696x754.jpg 696w, https://www.thepointng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220720-WA0030-388x420.jpg 388w, https://www.thepointng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220720-WA0030.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 277px) 100vw, 277px" />
