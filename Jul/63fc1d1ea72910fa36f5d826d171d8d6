…says, I’ll be re-elected Deputy Gov commends INEC, security, says turnout impressive BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO Osun State Governor and candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress, Gboyega Oyetola, has urged the Independent National Electoral Commission to deploy more BIVAS to polling units in order to ensure that the process is completed within the time frame. Addressing journalists after casting his vote at Local Authority Primary School, Popo, Iragbiji.
Ward 1, unit 2, Oyetola expressed hope of victory at the poll. Oyetola said, “The time frame that we have for this election, I think they (INEC) need to speed up or increase the number of machines so as to ensure that the process is concluded within the time frame. Other than that, I think I am satisfied. I have seen the presence of security agencies, they are doing well. I see the enthusiasm that voters are displaying to want to cast their votes. I am particularly very grateful to them, I believe that will show that people are conscious of the need to participate in the process. “Once the process is fair enough, people will be persuaded to vote. There won’t be voter apathy. This is indeed very impressive. I believe the time frame within which to complete the process would be a little bit long especially the places where we have a large number of voters as we can see, so it’s important for INEC to deploy more machines so as to complete the process within the time frame. By the grace of the Almighty God, I ma confident that I will be re-elected.” Also, the Deputy Governor of the State, Benedict Alabi, said considering their achievements in first term, the people of the state would consider them for second term. Alabi, who was accredited at 10:31am at his ward 6 unit 7, Baptist Day School, Ikire and voted at 10:32 am, adjudged the process as peaceful and orderly, with impressive turnout.
