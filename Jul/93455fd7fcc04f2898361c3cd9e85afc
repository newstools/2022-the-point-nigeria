Worshippers in Ilorin, the Kwara State capital, on Saturday turned out en masse to observe the 2-rakat Eid-el Kabir prayer, with Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq clearly setting the ground for a peaceful atmosphere with his open exchange of pleasantries with leading opposition figures. The Governor’s disposition, which underscored his political maturity, statesmanship and love for peace, drew applauses and commendations from creme de la creme of Ilorin and thousands of the Muslim faithfuls at the praying ground. His Chief Press Secretary, Rafiu Ajakaye, said in a statement in Ilorin on Saturday that shortly after arriving the Eid ground in company of his elder brother and Mutawali of Ilorin, Alimi AbdulRazaq, the Governor rose from his seat to exchange pleasantries and Eid felicitations with co-worshippers on the same roll, including former Senate President Bukola Saraki; former PDP National Chairman Kawu Baraje; and former Chief Justice of Nigeria Justice Alfa Belgore, amongst others. In a brief interview with reporters shortly before leaving for the palace to pay homage to the Emir, the Governor said he was glad about the peaceful Eid. “We thank God that we had a peaceful Eid. My message to Nigeria is about peace. As long as we have peace, our country will prosper and progress. We should all work for peace always. That is my Eid message,” he told reporters. The Eid prayer was led by the Chief Imam of Ilorin Sheikh Muhammad Bashir Soliu, who thereafter slaughtered sacrificial ram which symbolised the height of the Eid rites. Also at the Eid was the Emir of Ilorin, Ibrahim Sulu-Gambari, accompanied by a retinue of royal chiefs and kakaki-blaring traditional guards. The Eid was similarly attended by several statesmen, cabinet members, members of the governing and opposition parties.
