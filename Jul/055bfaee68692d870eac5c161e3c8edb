Former Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu and his wife, Beatrice were again denied bail on Thursday by a Westminster Court in the United Kingdom. The Senator and his wife are facing trial for allegedly coercing a minor that has been identified as David Ukpo to the UK to have his organ harvested to save the life of the Senators daughter, Sonia. While Ekweremadu was represented in court by Gavin Irwin, his wife was represented by Szilvia Booker. A high-powered Nigerian delegation was in court for the trial of the former Deputy Senate President. Among the notable Nigerians were a former Senate President, David Mark, under whom Ekweremadu served as his deputy, and a former Minister of State for Education, Emeka Nwajiuba. The court ruled that Ukpo, a purported Kidney donor for the daughter of Ike and Beatrice Ekweremadu, is not a minor. The young man who alleged that he was 15 years old and was being trafficked by the Ekweremadus, told Westminster Magistrates Court on Thursday that he is 21 years old. However, the court denied the couple bail and adjourned the case to August 4, 2022. Ekweremadu faces a charge of conspiracy to arrange or facilitate the travel of another person for exploitation, under the UKs Modern Slavery Act 2015. His wife, Beatrice, is charged with arranging or facilitating the travel of another person for exploitation.
