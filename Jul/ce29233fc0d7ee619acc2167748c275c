BY MAYOWA SAMUEL Police in Thailand and the disease control department on the southern island of Phuket are seeking the whereabouts of a missing Nigerian who was confirmed as the country’s first Monkeypox case. The 27-year-old patient was admitted to the hospital with fever, coughing, sore throat, runny nose, rashes and lesions and tests were carried out. Reports from the country said after learning the results of the laboratory tests, the hospital called the patient to arrange his transfer for medical treatments but he refused and switched off his mobile phone. The DDC director general, Opas Karnkawinpong, said a joint investigation team was sent to a private hospital in Phuket last Monday after the hospital suspected that one of its patients had monkeypox symptoms. Closed-circuit television footage showed the man leaving his accommodation after being informed of the positive test result on Monday and checking in to a hotel in Patong on the same day. Report added that the Nigerian on Tuesday at 9pm, placed his room key in reception and left. A Phuket health chief said the patient entered Thailand on October 21, 2021 and from November, he stayed in a condominium in Phuket’s Patong where he often visited entertainment venues in the province. Opas said disease control officials in the province had been instructed to monitor and identify any other potential cases in the province, to help limit the spread.
