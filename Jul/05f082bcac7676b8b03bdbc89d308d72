Neighbour reveals how deceased hubby struggled with fire, rejected by hospitals We’re making efforts to arrest fleeing wife – Police BY TIMOTHY AGBOR, OSOGBO A middle-aged housewife identified as Ifeoluwa Bamidele has allegedly been on the run after setting her husband ablaze and killing him over alleged extra-marital affairs. The victim, Bolu Bamidele, popularly known as Teebam, was said to have returned to Osogbo, capital of Osun State from Cairo, Egypt, to give his wife nice treats on her birthday. The wife, according to findings, discovered that Bamidele had cheated on her and even had a child outside their union. She was said to have gone through her husband’s phone and discovered the messages the deceased allegedly exchanged with another woman on WhatsApp. Ifeoluwa had confronted him with the information and an argument ensued. The incident reportedly happened on Sunday, July 17, 2022 at their residence in Koka-Ibokun community of Obokun Local Government Area of the state. It was gathered that Ifeoluwa allegedly sprinkled petrol in the bedroom while her husband was deeply asleep at night, locked the door and set the bedroom ablaze. She reportedly fled the residence immediately after the act. However, Bamidele’s agonizing screams were said to have drawn the attention of some neighbours who made efforts to rescue him. He was rushed to some hospitals in Osogbo but was rejected due to the magnitude of the burns sustained. He reportedly gave up the ghost after some hours of excruciating pains at the University College Hospital, Ibadan, Oyo State where he was eventually admitted. According to a source, “Teebam returned from Cairo to surprise his wife on her birthday. She discovered that he had cheated on her and even had a child outside their union. She confronted him with the information and an argument ensued. “Ifeoluwa proceeded to incinerate Teebam’s phones before setting him ablaze in their house. He was rushed to the hospital where he later died on Tuesday.” Ife reportedly left a cryptic post on her WhatsApp status before the act was committed. It reads, ‘I’ve always been a calm girl and I have never done this in my life but Teebam has pushed me to the edge. At this point, y’all will weep over myself and him before daybreak. I’m promising y’all that.” Meanwhile, one of the neighbours in the Koka community who spoke on the condition of anonymity explained that he saw the wife on the night the incident happened and that she was only putting on an underwear and was not wearing any foot wear. He said, “After I walked passed her (Ifeoluwa) on Sunday midnight, I discovered that she looked so strange. She didn’t greet me and was only wearing a knicker and brazier. She was not wearing any shoe. When I walked passed their house, I saw smoke coming out of the place and was hearing the agonizing sounds of someone. “So, I urgently invited other residents to help out. We discovered that the man (Bamidele) was already drunk when he slept and that was why he couldn’t rescue himself as expected. We eventually took him out of the bedroom through the window after we discovered that the door was locked. “I sustained burns on my hands while doing this. When we took him to one private hospital in Osogbo, we were rejected. We later took him to Osogbo Central Hospital at Oke-Baale, they accepted us there but referred us to UCH immediately because of the severity of the wounds. At this point, we were able to contact his family members and they took him to the hospital,” he added. Confirming the incident on Wednesday, the Public Relations Officer of the Osun State Police Command, Yemisi Opalola said Bamidele died at UCH around 4pm on Tuesday. She added that efforts were on top gear to arrest the fleeing wife. “At about 2330hrs of 17/7/22, one Bolu Bamidele of Koka Ibokun was set ablaze by his wife, Ifeoluwa Bamidele of same address. The victim was rushed to Osogbo Central Hospital. He was later referred to UCH, Ibadan for better treatment. The victim eventually died at the UCH around 4pm yesterday (Tuesday) 19/7/2022. “Efforts are on top gear to arrest the fleeing wife,” Opalola said. <img src="https://www.thepointng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220720-WA0047-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-98084" srcset="https://www.thepointng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220720-WA0047-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.thepointng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220720-WA0047-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.thepointng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220720-WA0047-696x696.jpg 696w, https://www.thepointng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220720-WA0047-420x420.jpg 420w, https://www.thepointng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220720-WA0047.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />
