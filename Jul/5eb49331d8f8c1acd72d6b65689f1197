This does not, however, apply to universities that have set for themselves cut off marks of 200 and above. It is the minimum, below which all universities cannot go, according to JAMB. The cut off mark was arrived at after rigorous deliberations by stakeholders, including the Vice-Chancellors of all universities, rectors and provosts of polytechnics and colleges of education, respectively, at JAMB’s 2022 Policy Meeting and 2020 NATAP-M Awards, held in Abuja.
