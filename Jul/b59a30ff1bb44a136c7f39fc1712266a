The Lagos State Government has suspended action on the recently released guidelines for abortion in the state following a garage of criticisms by concerned organizations. In a statement on Thursday by the Health Commissioner, Prof Akin Abayomi, says “Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has directed the suspension of the ‘State Guidelines on Safe Termination of Pregnancy for Legal Indications’ issued by the Directorate of Family Health and Nutrition in the Ministry of Health. “Among the several factors that contribute to maternal mortality, illegal abortions and high-risk pregnancies leading to unresolvable complications rank high. “The Lagos State Ministry of Health is seeking different methods to eliminate illegal abortions and ensure that a mother does not die at childbirth, thereby disrupting an entire family unit. “In this regard, it became imperative to examine, in keeping with existing National and State laws and policies, if there are indeed justifications and medical reasons to offer abortion to a woman, whose life is threatened by a pregnancy. “Following this, the guideline was developed over four years, through painstaking work by experts in Law and in Obstetrics and Gynaecology, with a focus on creating the opportunity to reduce maternal mortality and, in line with existing laws. “These guidelines have generated immense public interest which has necessitated escalating it to Mr Governor, who has advised further sensitisation of the public and key stakeholders to ensure a clearer understanding of the objectives of the guidelines. “To this end, we are suspending the implementation of these guidelines in the meantime for the Executive Council to deliberate on this matter and ensure adequate public sensitisation and stakeholder engagement to reach a consensus required for successful guideline development. “The Lagos State Ministry of Health remains committed to planning, devising and implementing policies that promote qualitative, affordable, and equitable healthcare services to the citizenry.”
