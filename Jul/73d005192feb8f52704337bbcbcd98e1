The Lagos State Building Control Agency (LASBCA) has clarified that no casualty was recorded during the recent building collapse that occurred at 15, Oke Arin Street, Ilupeju, in the early hours of Wednesday, 13th July, 2022, explaining that the affected building had been abandoned and already captured by the Agency as a distressed structure. The General Manager of LASBCA, Gbolahan Oki, stated further that the collapsed structure, which belongs to Christ Divine Apostolic Church, Oke-Arin, Mushin, was unoccupied at the time of the incident. He, therefore, implored members of the public to disregard any contrary information making the rounds in the media regarding casualty figures from the building collapse. “For clarity, no casualty was recorded in the three-floor building collapse which had earlier been captured as distressed and abandoned by our officials before the unfortunate incident occurred”. Oki noted that the site of the collapsed structure has been cordoned off alongside other abandoned buildings within the area, pending the commencement of demolition by the agency.
