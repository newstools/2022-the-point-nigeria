Three days after sealing a loan move to non-league club Chelmsford City, Arsenal’s Nigerian goalkeeper Ovie Ejeheri made his friendly debut for the Clarets as they suffered a narrow 2-1 loss to Haringey Borough. Ejeheri has moved to the National League South club in search of regular first team football, which Arsenal cannot offer him as he’s still learning the trade as a goalkeeper. Chelmsford City manager Robbie Simpson made plenty of changes during the break and one of them saw the Arsenal loanee replace Jacob Marsden in goal. After Hewitt-Bryne put the opponents in front in the first half, Trotter equalised for Chelmsford City with a well taken shot in the 67th minute. Ejeheri conceded his first goal in Chelmsford City colours, albeit in an unofficial game, with five minutes remaining when Georgiou found the top corner from outside the box. The 19-year-old, who is also eligible to represent the national teams of England and Uganda, will be hoping to make his competitive debut for Chelmsford City on the opening day of the National League South season when they host St Albans City. Ejeheri has cited Juventus and Italy legend Gianluigi Buffon as his role model.
